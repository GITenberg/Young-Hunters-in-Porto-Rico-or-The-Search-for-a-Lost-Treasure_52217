  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"The Young Hunters in Porto Rico" has been
written at the earnest solicitation of a number
of my young readers, who wished to follow the
further adventures of the Gun and Sled Club.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a former volume of this series, "Gun and
Sled," I related how the club was formed and
what a jolly time its members had during a winter
outing on Snow-Top Island. In the present
tale, one of the members becomes the proud
owner of a yacht, and of course nothing will do
but to take an ocean trip on the craft. During
this trip the boys learn of a Spanish treasure
said to be secreted in one of the great caves near
Caguas, on the island of Porto Rico, and at
once a hunt is instituted, and many stirring
adventures follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The work was written primarily for the reader's
amusement, yet I have endeavored within
its pages to give a fair description of the Porto
Rico of to-day, as it appears to a traveler from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>our States. This new island domain of ours is
but little known to the majority of us, but when
its picturesqueness, and its mild climate, become
a matter of publicity, Porto Rico is bound
to become the Mecca for thousands of American
tourists, in search of health and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the number of letters received, I am
led to believe that "Gun and Sled" was well
liked by my readers. If this is so, I sincerely
trust that the present volume does not fall below
the other in merit.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>"What do you think of the weather, Bob?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It looks like a storm, Dick, and a heavy one,
too."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Exactly my idea. I wonder how far we are
from the lighthouse?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can't say. Jacob!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is it, Master Robert?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"How far is it to the lighthouse?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The old Yankee sailor at the wheel of the
Dashaway rubbed his grizzled chin and cast
his eyes about before replying.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I reckon as how it is about two miles or so,"
he said, with deliberation. "We have been running
putty lively, you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you imagine we can make it before that
blow comes up?" asked Dick Wilbur, anxiously.
"We don't want to lose a stick out here."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can do our best, sir. But we've got to
work for it, for the wind is going down fast."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>"I see that, Jacob. Hadn't you better throw
her over a point or two?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll throw her over all she'll stand," answered
Jacob Ropes, as he moved the handles
of the brass-bound and highly polished steering
wheel of the yacht. "Don't you think we had
better lower the mainsail?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think a couple of reefs will be enough—for
the present," replied Dick Wilbur. "We can
get the canvas in on the run when it freshens
up."</p>

<p class='c000'>At this old Jacob Ropes shook his head doubtfully,
but as Dick Wilbur was commonly looked
upon as the leader in the present outing, he said
nothing in opposition. Both Dick Wilbur and
Bob Hobart sprang to the halyards, and soon
the mainsail was set to the former's satisfaction.
The topsail had already been stowed away, and
now the jib was likewise made safe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dashaway had been cruising off the shore
of the Carolinas for the best part of a week.
She was as trim and substantial a yacht as one
could meet anywhere, and had been built especially
for Dick Wilbur's uncle by a firm of ship
constructors who made a specialty of this class
of work. She was long and narrow—yet not
too narrow for safety—and while her mast was
a towering one, the ballast of lead in her keel
was sufficient to render her sailing qualities
good even in a heavy blow.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>In a former story, entitled "Gun and Sled,"
I told how four boys, Dick Wilbur, Bob Hobart,
Don Harrison and Leander Carson organized
the Gun and Sled Club, and went off on a long
winter outing on Snow-Top Island. They were
accompanied by Danny Guirk, a poor but merry-hearted
Irish lad, who did all sorts of odds and
ends of work for them, and amid snow and ice
the club went gunning, fishing, ice-boat sailing
and the like to their hearts' content.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the lads returned to their homes in
Waterford, it was decided by a unanimous vote
to make the club a permanent one, and the snow
still lay on the ground while they were planning
for their outing during the coming summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first it was decided to go up the lake upon
which the village was situated, again, for another
trip to the island where they had had so
much sport; but the departure of Dick Wilbur's
uncle for China caused a change in their plans.
Dick was named after this relative, and before
going away, Mr. Richard Wilbur gave to his
namesake the Dashaway.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sure you will appreciate the gift, my
boy," had been his words. "Have the best of
good times on the craft, but take care that you
don't get drowned."</p>

<p class='c000'>My young readers can well imagine how delighted
Dick was over this gift. The youth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>was now president of the club, and it instantly
came into his head to invite the members to take
the contemplated outing on board of the yacht.
"And I'll take you anywhere that you want to
go," had been Dick's concluding remark on making
the offer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proposition was accepted as quickly as
made, and then came the question of where they
should go. Waterford lay a good many miles
from the ocean, but an easy passage could be
had by means of several lakes and a broad river,
and it was finally decided that they should
spread the Dashaway's white wings on the broad
Atlantic, for a sail down the coast to Florida.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was to be a long trip from home, and it
was felt by the boys' parents that some older
person should go with them. Squire Hobart,
Bob's father, knew old Jacob Ropes well, and
knew he was a first-class sailor, and it was this
Yankee who was hired to do the main sailing of
the yacht and keep a watchful eye over the lads.
Old Jacob was as good-hearted a tar as could be
found anywhere, and it did not take long for
him and the members of the club to become
warm friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't think we are going to have any fishing
to-day," remarked Leander Carson, as Dick
came forward to where he and Don Harrison
sat, near the companionway.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>"I don't believe we're going to have any for
several days, Leander," answered Dick, as he
again surveyed the clouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We're in for a big storm—I'm certain of it,"
came from Don. "If we—There goes Danny's
gong!"</p>

<p class='c000'>A loud beating of a wooden spoon on a tin
platter had broken in on his speech. Now
there appeared above the companionway steps
the face of a chubby Irish lad wearing a big
apron and a four-cornered cook's cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All hands be afther comin' down fer dinner!"
cried the young cook of the club. "An' don't
waste no time or dem apple dumplin's will all
be cold," he added.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All right, Danny, we'll be down," answered
Dick. "I can tell you what, boys, this sailing
around gives a fellow a tremendous appetite."</p>

<p class='c000'>"As if there was ever anything the matter
with your eating apparatus," laughed Bob.
"But say, Danny's bluefish does smell immense,
doesn't it?" he went on, and was the first to slip
down into the small but elegant cabin of which
the Dashaway boasted. The others immediately
followed, and soon all were feasting on
the spread the Irish lad had prepared for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Danny, I'll recommend you to the Waldorf-Astoria
if ever I get to New York," observed
Bob, as he paused, with a cob of green corn in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>his hands. "As a cook you're getting to be
A No. 1."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't want no recommendation," returned
the Irish lad, blushing. "It's good enough fun
fer me to be waiting on dis crowd."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And how do you like the ocean, Danny?"
questioned Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"De ocean is all right—if only it would stop
rollin' once in awhile. Sometimes I'm afther
t'inkin' I'm goin' ter turn inside out, dat's all,"
and Danny hurried off to the galley fire to bring
on the dessert.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wonder if we'll have any such adventures
on this trip as we had up to Hotchkiss and
Snow-Top Islands," remarked Leander. "Don't
you remember those bears, and how we got lost
in the blizzard, and all that?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't believe we'll meet any bears out here,"
said Bob, solemnly, as he turned his gaze to the
ceiling. He was bound to have his joke whenever
he got the chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, stow it, Bob, you know what I mean.
Of course we can't meet bears on the ocean, but
we might meet a—a, whale, or a waterspout, or
something like that."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And instead of a blizzard we might meet a
gale that would send us to the bottom," put in
Leander. "That would just suit you, wouldn't
it?—just for the excitement."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>"I sincerely hope we don't have any trouble,"
began Dick, seriously. "All I ask for is a pleasant
trip, with good fishing and fine bathing, and
maybe a little hunting, when we reach the
Florida shore."</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the apple dumplings had been
brought on, and for several minutes the conversation
lagged, as the boys paid strict attention
to the dainties with their appetizing sauce of
butter and sugar. The dumplings were scarcely
finished when there came a shrill whistle
from the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sound proceeded from a whistle which
old Jacob was in the habit of using when he
wanted to call one and another, and they happened
to be out of calling distance. Rushing
up the companionway, Dick gave one glance at
the heavens and saw the reason for the summons.
Half of the sky was literally black with
clouds of wind and rain, and already behind the
Dashaway could be seen the angry white-caps,
growing larger and coming closer each instant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All hands on deck, and be quick about it!"
he yelled. "Jacob, hadn't Leander better take
the wheel?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, and lose no time," answered the Yankee
sailor, and as Leander relieved him, he ran
forward with the other boys and began to stow
away the mainsail. In the meantime Danny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>received orders to fasten down the hatch and
close up all of the portholes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We're in for it, beyond a doubt," said Dick,
as the breeze struck the yacht with increasing
force, tearing savagely through the riggings and
causing Don to shudder. The rain now began
to fall, and all of the club members, and old
Jacob donned their oilskins.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can't make the harbor now," announced
the old Yankee. "If we tried it, we may run
on the rocks and be smashed to pieces. We'll
have to run out." And he threw the yacht over,
something that made her dip considerably, and
which sent more than one wave rushing over her
bow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind now commenced to shriek dismally,
and the darkened sky was lit up with distant
flashes of lightning, invariably followed by long,
low rumbles of thunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can't see de use uf runnin' into dat storm,"
piped up Danny Guirk. "If I was runnin'
t'ings I'd steer fer de land, dat's wot I would
do."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You be careful, or you'll go overboard—"
began Bob, when a yell from Dick interrupted
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here it comes, boys! Hold hard, all of you!
My, but isn't it a corker!"</p>

<p class='c000'>A ripping crack of thunder and a blinding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>flash of lightning drowned out the last of his
words, and then the very heavens appeared to
open, to let down a deluge of water that threatened
to swamp the gallant yacht. A hurricane
of wind followed, and the waves lashed and
pounded the craft upon every side.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By gum!" came suddenly from old Jacob.
"Did any of ye see thet, boys?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"See what?" demanded Don and Dick in a
breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The small boat over to starboard. She was
bottom side up and somebody was a-clingin' to
her!"</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br /> THE MAN FROM THE WRECK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>All on board the Dashaway were intensely
interested in the discovery old Jacob had made.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are sure you saw the small boat?" questioned
Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I didn't see a thing," declared Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor did I," added Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I saw the boat right enough, lads," returned
the old Yankee tar. "It was out there," he
pointed with his long forefinger. "Look! look!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Another flash of lightning had lit up the
firmament, making all as bright as day. Not
fifty yards from the Dashaway all beheld an
upturned rowboat, just rising to the top of one
of the long ocean swells. To one end of the
tiny craft a man was clinging desperately. It
was possible that he was crying for help, but if
so, the uproar of the storm drowned out his
voice completely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dat fellow will be lost sure!" burst out
Danny Guirk. "Poor man, he must feel awful!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We must try to save him," came from Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's true," said Don. "But how?"</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/p016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>"I don't see what we can do, with such a sea
running," added Leander. "If we get much
closer we'll run him down."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can go a little nearer, and then we can
try to throw him a rope with a life preserver
attached," concluded Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>To attempt to do more than keep the yacht
headed in the teeth of the gale was a hazardous
undertaking. Yet all on board the Dashaway
realized that a human life was in peril, and that
some risk must be run in order to effect a rescue,
were such a thing possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can't see him now," said old Jacob, as the
lightning seemed to subside for the time being.
"It's as black as night."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us fire up with a Bengal light," suggested
Leander, and ran off for the article.
Soon it was spluttering in the rain, but brightening
up the scene about them for several hundred
feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Help! help!" came faintly to their ears, as
the Dashaway drew closer to the upturned rowboat.
"Don't leave me to perish! Help!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Catch the life line!" roared Dick, and whirling
the article over his head, he let fly with all
the strength and skill at his command.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a clever throw, the line shooting over
the middle of the small boat and the life preserver
hitting the water just beyond. The castaway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>caught hold of both, but hesitated about
letting go of the rowboat that had so far saved
him from a watery grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Haul in, all of you!" cried Dick. "I'll stand
at the rail with this boathook and try to keep
him from being pounded on the yacht's side."</p>

<p class='c000'>The young leader's instructions were obeyed,
and slowly but surely the upturned boat and
its occupant came closer. But then came a huge
wave, and man and boat parted company and
disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hold tight!" screamed Dick, as the man reappeared,
and then he reached down with the
boathook, and in a twinkle the rescued one came
sprawling on the deck, while Dick slipped flat
on his back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rescue had taken place none too soon, for
now the storm increased in fury, and old Jacob
lashed himself to the wheel, while ordering all
of the others below.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He has fainted," said Leander, as he knelt
over the man who had been saved. "Let us
carry him below;" and this was done. In the
cabin the stranger was made as comfortable as
possible and stimulants were administered; but
it was a long time before he either spoke or
moved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm lasted all of the afternoon and the
greater part of the night, and nobody thought of
going to sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>"If you wanted an adventure, Leander, I
guess you are getting it," remarked Don, grimly.
"This is worse than that blizzard. I'll be thankful
if we get out of this with whole skins."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dis is de greatest storm I ever seed," put in
Danny. "If de boat shakes much more, everyt'ing
in de crockery line will be gone to smash,
dat's a fact," and he rolled off to secure his
dishes and pans from such a catastrophe.
Several dishes and glasses were wrecked, but
not as many as Danny imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man who had been rescued was a heavy-set
individual of twenty-five or thirty years of
age, and Dick rightfully guessed that he was
an Englishman. He had been struck on the
head, and it was found that a nasty cut must
be plastered up and then bound with a cloth.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Poor fellow, he has certainly had a hard time
of it," observed Don. "I'm glad we managed to
save him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And so am I glad," returned Dick. "I'll
wager he'll have a story worth telling when he
gets around to it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I have a tale worth telling," came with
a gasp from the sufferer; but having opened his
eyes for a moment, he closed them again, and
said nothing more for fully half an hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fury of the storm had caused the Dashaway
to move far out to sea, and when, at eleven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>in the morning, old Jacob announced that all
danger was over, they calculated that it would
take them twenty-four hours and more to reach
Savannah, whither they had been bound for
some extra ship's supplies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't care—so long as we have enough eating
to last us," was Dick's comment. "I'm
happy to escape with my life."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And I am happy to think that we have been
the means of saving somebody else," put in Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both had gone on deck to see what old Jacob
had to say about their next movement. They
returned to the cabin to find the rescued man
stirring again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have saved my life, lads," were his first
words. "I shall never forget you for that,
never!" and he put out his hand feebly, for one
and another to press.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did you fall overboard from some boat?"
questioned Dick, kindly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I did—that is, I am not quite sure," was the
measured answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are not sure?" repeated Don, with a
puzzled look.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, I am not quite sure. I was standing by
the steamer's rail and the ship was pitching terribly.
Suddenly I was lifted off my feet—how
I cannot tell—and then I found myself pitching
headlong into the water. It is strange!
strange!—" And the man drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>"Do you mean to say that you think somebody
might have pitched you into the ocean?" cried
Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sure of nothing, my lads. But—but—there
was one man on board the Advance who
would not have been above heaving me overboard,
were the chance given to him." The sufferer
looked around curiously. "You have saved
my life; I don't know but that I may as well tell
you my secret."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We would certainly like to hear your story,"
returned Leander, bluntly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then I will tell it as well as I am able. In
the first place, I am an Englishman, and my
name is Robert Menden. Less than two weeks
ago I took passage on the steamship Advance,
bound from Liverpool to Havana, Cuba. I
wished to sail direct for Porto Rico, but could
not obtain the passage, so took what I considered
the next best thing. You know it is
easy to get passage to any of the West Indies
from Havana."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I know that," returned Dick. "Havana
is quite a center of trade."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I was bound to Porto Rico in search of a fortune,
which I heard of quite by accident while
I was travelling in Spain nearly a year ago. On
board the Advance was a man who knew my
secret. He was an old enemy of mine, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>cannot get it out of my head but that he helped
me overboard, not only to get rid of me, but
also that he might secure the treasure for himself."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br /> SOMETHING ABOUT A GREAT TREASURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"A treasure!" cried Don, as Robert Menden
paused, to partake of some soup which Danny
had brought to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, a treasure, lads—a treasure said to be
worth twenty or thirty thousand dollars. Of
course, that is not a fabulous sum, but it is
pretty large for a poor Englishman like me, who
has never had over two hundred pounds in his
life."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's enough!" cried Dick. "I'd like to pick
it up myself."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But what kind of a treasure is it?" questioned
Leander. "Won't you tell us more about
it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And about your enemy?" added Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will tell you everything, lads—for I have
nothing to conceal, and you have been very kind
to me. But first let me say, that I am at present
totally unable to pay you for what you are
doing for me now."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We don't want any pay," came from Dick
promptly, and the others nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>"As far as I know, I am not worth a dollar
in the world, as you Americans would put it.
I had something like eighty pounds in my pocket
when I fell overboard, but my wallet is gone,
and here is all I now possess." And Robert
Menden held out a shining shilling and several
English pennies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll try to set you on your feet again,"
came from Bob, who was always generous to
the core. "We are not rich, but we can do
something; can't we, fellows?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To be sure," answered Don. "But won't you
tell your story, about your enemy and that
treasure? I declare, it sounds like a book!"
and he smiled broadly. Don had always been a
great boy to read stories of pirates, treasures,
Indians, and marvellous boy hunters and
trappers. Yet he had never had his head turned
by these bits of thrilling fiction.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, to begin with, as I said before, I am
an Englishman, and was born and brought up
in a village not far from the city of London.
Our family was fairly well-to-do, and for twenty
years of my life matters ran smoothly enough.
But then my parents died, and I being alone,
moved into London, and became a clerk in a
firearms store.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In this store there was another clerk named
Joseph Farvel. Joseph was not of the friendly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>sort, and he hated me from the start, because
he had expected to get the place I was filling,
for a friend of his, who was to pay him five
pounds for obtaining the situation for him.
He tried to get me into trouble, so that I would
be discharged and he would have another chance
for his friend, but his little plot against me was
discovered, and he was thrown out in consequence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"From that moment on Joseph Farvel was my
bitter enemy, and he tried in several ways to
injure me. Finally, I caught him one day in
the park and gave him a sound thrashing, and
told him if he ever interfered with me again I
would have him arrested. As long as I remained
in London I never saw him again."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And I shouldn't think you would want to see
him," put in Dick, as Robert Menden paused, to
partake of the warm soup once again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When I became head clerk for the firearms
firm, I was sent to Madrid, Spain, to look up a
certain contract with the Spanish Government
for small arms. In the meantime, Joseph Farvel
had secured a position with another firearms
company, and they were also after this
contract. We met in Madrid and another
quarrel ensued, but nothing came of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I secured the contract, and was on the point
of returning to England, when I fell in with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>old Spanish sailor who had spent much of his
time in Cuban and Porto Rican waters. I did
this fellow several favors, and in return for this
he told me of a treasure said to be hidden away
in one of the great caves of Porto Rico, which
are located to the southwest of Caguas, and five
miles west of the village of Aguas Buenas."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what was the treasure?" cried Leander,
who sat by, his mouth half open in wonder.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a treasure in Spanish gold, said to
have been placed in the cavern by a smuggler,
who had journeyed inland after he had found
the coast of Porto Rico too hot to hold him. It
was said to be locked up in a strong cedar chest,
and buried under a long, flat stone upon which
was cut a cross and the initials M. M. M."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That ought to be easy to find—if you can
locate the cave," said Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Exactly—if I can locate the cave. But you
must remember that, although the caves of
Porto Rico are but little known, the largest of
them, called the Dark Cave, is said to rival
your own Mammoth Cave of Kentucky."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious! If it's as big as that, then that's
another question," returned Bob, and his face
fell, for he was already thinking of taking a
hand at treasure-hunting himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have some fairly good directions as to how
to reach the cave," went on Robert Menden.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>He cleared his throat. "But I am getting
ahead of my tale. I heard of this treasure in
Madrid, and strange as it may seem, Joseph
Farvel heard of it, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When I returned to London, bad news
awaited me. The firm I had represented had
failed, and instead of getting a large sum of
money for my success in Madrid, I was thrown
out of employment. Times were hard and I
could not secure another situation, and at last
I sailed for Havana, intending to go from there
to Ponce, Porto Rico, and then strike out into
the interior of the island in search of the hidden
chest of gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You can well imagine my surprise when on
the second day out I ran across Joseph Farvel,
who had also taken passage for Cuba. We
quarrelled once more, and he accused me of dogging
his footsteps, and of wanting to get his
treasure away from him. I told him I wanted
nothing to do with him and that I reckoned the
treasure would belong to the first man who
found it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And so he threw you overboard later on!" exclaimed
Leander. "What a rascal!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am not certain that he did. I was not feeling
well and I was also very sleepy, and it may
be that I fell overboard by pure accident. And
yet I cannot get it out of my mind but that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>sneaked up behind me and gave me a gentle lift
and a shove, just as the steamship was swinging
to aid him." Robert Menden paused.
"That is my story, and now let me know what
you think of it, and where you are bound, and
what you intend to do with me."</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> A COMPACT OF IMPORTANCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"It's certainly a strange story," mused Dick,
and looked questioningly at the other club members,
and at Danny, who stood at the doorway,
taking in with wide open eyes all that was being
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sure, an' if I was youse fellers I'd hunt up
dat gold!" remarked the Irish lad. "Twenty
t'ousand dollars! Dat's a regular—er—mint,
dat is!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's not ours to hunt up," answered Bob;
but he looked at Dick questioningly, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You want to know what I think of your
story," said the leader of the club, addressing
the man they had saved. "I think it's a mighty
interesting yarn."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And where are you bound?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We were bound for Savannah, to take on
some extra ship's stores. But the storm made
us turn out to sea again, and the wind has carried
us a good bit out of our course."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>"It looks to me as if you lads were out for
pleasure."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are right. We form an organization
known as the Gun and Sled Club. Last winter
we spent a large part of our time in the woods
and had immense fun. This spring my uncle
left me this yacht, and we decided to sail down
the Atlantic coast as far as Florida, and then
go hunting and fishing and sporting generally.
But I guess it's time we introduced ourselves;"
and Dick proceeded to go through the usual
form for all hands but old Jacob, who was still
on deck, in sole charge, now that the storm was
over.</p>

<p class='c000'>The introduction and hand-shaking made
everybody feel more at home, and Robert Menden
questioned several of them concerning the
contemplated outing. "I presume you will land
me at either Savannah or in Florida," he concluded.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Supposing we land you in Porto Rico?" said
Bob, with a sudden twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will you do that?" asked Robert Menden,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a pretty good sail for the Dashaway,"
said Bob, thoughtfully. "But I think it would
be all right—if we could make the stores hold
out."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hurrah! let us go to Porto Rico!" shouted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Leander, who stood by. "I wanted to say go
before, but I hardly dared."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can you go if you want to?" questioned the
Englishman, as he gazed from one to another
of the boys.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly," said Dick. "We can go where
we please, for our time is our own, and so is our
money—what little there is of it. We are not
millionaires' sons, you know," he added, with
a smile. "We are working this outing on as
cheap a scale as possible."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are better off than I, who haven't a
pound——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"But you'll get that treasure—" broke in
Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps." Robert Menden looked very
thoughtful. "Boys, I have a proposal to make
to you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm ready for it, and I'll say 'yes' in advance,"
cried Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you know what is in my mind,"
laughed the Englishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You want us to take you to Porto Rico?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And want us to help you hunt for that
treasure?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"If you care to do so. And I will give you a
share of what is found."</p>

<p class='c000'>"How much?" asked Don, who was breathing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>hard, and fancied he had the treasure already in
his possession.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is a matter to be talked over. You see,
I have lost my money, so if we all go together,
you will have to bear the expenses of the trip."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll keep the expenses down—we'll have to
do it," put in Dick. "What kind of a bargain
are you willing to make?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden thought for a moment. "I
want to go to Porto Rico immediately, so that I
can reach that cave before Joseph Farvel. If
you set sail in that direction without delay, I
think we can beat him, even if he takes a
steamer from Havana to Ponce."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I guess you are right there," answered
Leander. He got out a chart and studied it for
a moment. "At a rough estimate we are now
about a thousand miles from the coast of Porto
Rico, while the distance to that point from
Havana, Cuba, is several hundred miles longer."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And your enemy may have to lay over several
days for a steamer," put in Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If he thinks you are dead he won't hurry,"
added Dick. "Perhaps he will stay in Havana
for a week or two."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is what I was thinking," resumed
Robert Menden. "Yet he is a very greedy fellow,
and he will want to lay hands on that gold
just as quickly as he can."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>"Well, I guess anybody would want to do
that," laughed Leander. "Such a sum of money
is not to be sneezed at."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am willing to sail for Porto Rico as soon as
we can, but we ought to have some ship's stores
for such a long trip," said Dick. "We have no
fresh vegetables left, so Danny tells me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, you must do as you think best about
that," answered the Englishman. "But to get
to business, as you Americans would say. If
you will take me to Porto Rico as speedily as
you can, and accompany me on a trip inland to
where this cave is said to be located, and will
bear all expenses—making them as little as possible—I
will agree to give you one-quarter of all
that is found."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A quarter of twenty thousand dollars would
be five thousand," said Bob. "That's not bad."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And, remember, the treasure may be worth
thirty thousand—or more," put in Leander.
"I move this club take up with Mr. Menden's
offer."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I second the motion," cried Don, promptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ditto!" came from Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The motion is put—and carried unanimously,"
said Dick, almost as quickly. "Mr.
Menden, from henceforth we are at your service,
so far as our means afford and as long as we can
keep out of positive danger."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>"Let us put our agreement in writing," suggested
Leander, who was going to have no trip-up
in the matter. This was also agreed to, and
the tall youth was set to work on the important
document. When it was finished, both Robert
Menden and Dick signed it, and Danny Guirk
and old Jacob added their names as witnesses.</p>

<p class='c000'>A long consultation was had, and it was resolved
to run for St. Augustine, on the Florida
coast, and there procure such supplies as were
necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The course of the Dashaway was changed, and
the wind being still fresh, they made good progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Get your list ready," said Bob, "so we won't
have to stay ashore any longer than is necessary."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm preparing the list now," answered Dick,
who was consulting with Danny. The Irish
boy was in high delight, having been promised a
round hundred dollars extra, should the proposed
hunt for the treasure prove successful.
Old Jacob had been put down for a like sum,
also to the old tar's satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The run to St. Augustine proved without special
interest. The boys found Robert Menden a
nice companion. The Englishman had not only
travelled a good bit, but had also been a great
reader, and he was not above telling a good
story whenever called upon to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>"I had a pretty fair wardrobe," he said, on the
morning following the conversation just mentioned.
"But now I haven't anything but what
is on my back."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You can look over the things on the yacht,"
replied Dick. "Some of them, I think, will fit
you—and what else must be had can be purchased
in St. Augustine."</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the start from home all of the boys had
taken a deep interest in the yacht, and old
Jacob had succeeded in making a fairly good
sailor of each of them. But there were still
many things to learn, and now Robert Menden
announced that he would take lessons in seamanship,
too.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't want you to think I am lazy," he said.
"I am just as willing to work as anybody. I
expect by the time Porto Rico is reached I'll be
a regular old salt."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can't get to that island fast enough for
me," cried Bob. "I'm crazy to get at that
treasure." And he felt like dancing a jig for
joy, little dreaming of all the thrilling adventures
and grave perils in store for the party.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br /> AN ADVENTURE IN ST. AUGUSTINE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Hurrah! we are in sight of the coast!"</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Dick who uttered the cry, late in the
afternoon of the second day after the conversation
recorded above.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dashaway had made a clean run of over
a hundred and thirty miles, and had come in
sight of the coast but a few miles above the little
river upon which St. Augustine is situated,
about two miles from the rolling Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately, old Jacob knew these waters
thoroughly, so the run to the river and up to the
ancient Spanish city was not a hazardous one.
As soon as they dropped anchor, all of the boys
went ashore and Robert Menden went with
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no easy matter to rush through Dick's
long orders for stores, but they did their best,
and by two o'clock of the afternoon following,
the yacht was ready for a journey of a thousand
miles or more.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We won't live on the fat of the land,"
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>grinned Dick. "But we won't have to live on
salt meat, either."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't mind some salt meat," smiled Robert
Menden, "but I don't like too much of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>While Dick was superintending the loading
of the stores, Don and Bob strolled off to take a
look at the ancient town, which possesses several
points of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a good deal different from things North,"
observed Don. "Even the trees are different.
How beautiful the palms are!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I guess we'll see as much of tropical life as
we care for when we reach Porto Rico," replied
Bob. "Gracious, but it's warm!" he added, wiping
the perspiration from his brow.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And we'll find it hot enough, too," laughed
his chum. "That trip to the interior won't be
exactly a picnic, Bob."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's true. But then a fellow can stand
something for the sake of making a lot of money.
I wish we had time to stay here a few days. I
would like to go out into the wood with a gun,
and see what I could knock over."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, it's a pity we can't have at least one
day's fishing and hunting. But then we must
get to Porto Rico before that Joseph Farvel.
What a scamp he must be!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The world is full of such chaps. But if only
we can outwit him I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The walk of the two boys took them to one
of the broad highways leading to the residential
portion of the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>The highway was lined with carriages coming
and going, and bicycles were likewise numerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wouldn't mind a ride on a wheel myself,"
observed Don. "Those fellows seem to enjoy it
thoroughly," and he pointed to four boys, all in
uniform, who were riding wheels which were
peculiarly striped in red, white and blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They carry the flag colors," smiled his chum.
"They must be patriotic."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what real, live American lad isn't patriotic,
Bob?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"True for you. If we—Hullo, what does that
mean?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob broke off short and pointed up the broad
highway.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around a bend a fine carriage had appeared,
drawn by a team of coal black steeds.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some reason not now apparent, the team
had taken their bits in their teeth and were
running away at topmost speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The turnout had two seats, but its sole occupant
was a little girl not over six or seven years
of age—a pale, blue-eyed creature, with yellow
curls streaming down her back.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Help! stop the bad, bad horses!" sobbed the
little girl, as the tears of terror ran down her
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>"By ginger! this is awful!" gasped Don.
"That little girl will be thrown out and killed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can't we stop the horses?" questioned Bob.
"We must do it somehow!" he added, with sudden
determination.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chums had been walking along the side
of the highway, but now Bob ran out directly
in the path of the oncoming team.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Be careful, Bob!" yelled Don, but, nevertheless,
he followed his chum, at the same time pulling
off the light jacket he wore over his outing
shirt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob set his teeth hard. Half a dozen people
were yelling at him, but it is doubtful if he
heard a word of the advice. His one thought
was centered on the little girl and what he
might do to save the creature. "I must do it,"
he muttered. "I <em>must</em>!"</p>

<p class='c000'>On and on came the team, carriage drivers
and bicyclists losing no time in getting out of
the way, so that they themselves might escape
injury. In such a moment, "self-preservation is
the first law of nature," to nine out of every ten
human beings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whizz! It was Don's coat that flew forth,
just as the team ranged up almost in front of
him. The youth's aim was good, for the garment
shot past the nose of the nearest steed, to
land on the head of the second, thus momentarily
checking the mad dash of the pair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>As the coat came from one side, Bob leaped
from the other, clasping the steed nearest to
him around the neck. Then Don's garment
slipped to the highway, and away went the
horses again, the reins dangling at their heels
and the carriage swaying violently from side to
side, as the wheels found stone, hollow or rut
along the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately for Bob, his hold was a good one,
and pulling up his legs, the youth was enabled
to keep clear of the horse's hoofs, which came
up rather high as he kept to his mad chase.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bob, look out!" came from Don, and then
turnout and boy passed out of hearing of the
chum left standing in a cloud of dust, coatless
and hatless, and without knowing what to do
next.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a short distance away was a side road,
much rougher than the main highway. As the
team went on, the horse carrying Bob's weight
lagged slightly behind, and when the side road
was reached, both steeds turned and darted in
the new direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time poor Bob realized that he had
cut out a large piece of work for himself. He
wanted to swing himself up on the animal's
back, but for several minutes was unable to do
so. In the meantime the carriage swayed more
violently than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>"Stop the bad horses!" shrieked the little girl,
and then arose to her feet, as if to jump from the
carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sit down!" cried Bob, as he caught a brief
glance of the little maiden. "Sit down, or
you'll get hurt worse!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl heard his words, but hesitated about
accepting his suggestion. Bob had now one
foot across the horse's back, and with one mighty
pull he hauled himself up on the steed's neck.
The animal tried to throw him, but the youth
was game, and a second later had jumped to the
rear and was leaning down, gathering up the
reins.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, dear me!" gasped the little girl, as she
saw him pick up the leathers. Then came a
leap, and Bob landed on the front seat of the
carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy now had the reins, and each was
twisted tightly about his wrist. But could he
haul in such a fiery team? It looked doubtful.</p>

<p class='c000'>He braced his feet as well as he was able, and
hauled back. One horse had lost the bit, but
the other had not, and away went the latter with
renewed energy, which it seemed that nothing
could overcome.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack! It was the frail dashboard of the
carriage that had given way, and in an instant
Bob's foot went through a hole, which held his
leg as if in a vise.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>"More trouble," was his thought, and he
sought to extricate himself from this new difficulty,
but still keeping tight hold of the lines,
knowing only too well that if they slipped down
again, the attempted rescue would be a failure.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Please, please stop the bad, bad horses!"
pleaded the girl, who occupied the seat behind
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will—if I can," panted Bob. "But sit
down, or you may be thrown out. There's a
bend ahead."</p>

<p class='c000'>The bend was not far off, and Bob still trying
to free his leg from the wreck of the dashboard
when the team made the turn so closely that
the carriage went up high on the wheels of one
side. For a few seconds it looked as if the turnout
would be thrown over, but it gradually
righted itself, and on they went again, more
madly than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around the bend, the trees and bushes were
thick, and but little could be seen. Yet presently
a sight caught Bob's eyes which fairly
made his heart stop beating.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were approaching the river bank fairly
and squarely, and in less than half a minute
more the end of the road would be gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The river!" wailed the little girl. "We will
drown!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not if I can help it!" answered Bob, and
pulled on the reins harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Then came a snap, as one of the reins parted
close to the boy's hand, and over he tumbled to
the side of the seat, leaving the team, uncontrolled,
to dash on to their fate, carrying himself
and the little girl with them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> INTO THE RIVER AND OUT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"My gracious! what had I best do now?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob uttered the words mechanically, as with
staring eyes he gazed at the stretch of water
which the carriage was approaching so rapidly.
He felt that it would be impossible to stop the
team before the river bank was gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>With might and main he sought to loosen his
foot. But that member had caught between a
bit of the dashboard and a brace, and was as
fast as if in a bear trap.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little girl began to scream, but Bob hardly
heard her. Along jounced the turnout, then
came a slight pause, and over the bank went the
team, landing in the river with a loud splash.
The carriage followed, and on the instant the
youth found himself under the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was truly a situation of extreme peril, and
it is a wonder that poor Bob did not lose utter
control of himself. But even in that dire hour
he felt that if he would save himself he must
have his wits about him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>As he went under, the horses were forgotten,
and bending forward, he caught the shattered
dashboard in both hands and endeavored to
wrench it asunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was hard work, and as he applied himself
to it he felt the carriage turning, until it was
bottom side up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That poor girl!" he thought, and tugged
away harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last came a pull that loosened his foot.
It was high time, for his breath was almost gone
and a strange light seemed to flicker before his
brain. Clearing himself of the wreck, he darted
upward to the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She's gone!" was his thought, as he filled his
lungs with the fresh air which they so much
needed. He had saved himself, but his heart
was heavy to think that most likely the little
girl had been drowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly his eyes caught sight of a white
object floating some twenty feet away. He gave
a second look and recognized the little girl's
dress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately, as my old readers know, Bob
was a good swimmer, and without hesitation he
struck out for the floating object. As he came
closer he saw that the little maiden was still
conscious.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Help me!" she wailed, when she saw him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>"Don't let me go down in the cold water,
please!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will save you," said Bob, firmly. "Here,
put your arms around my neck," and he caught
hold of her, for he saw that she was more than
ready to sink to rise no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was wonderful what trust the little girl
imposed upon this youth whom she had never
before met. Bob's face was a thoroughly honest
and reliable one, and youth sometimes
reads character better than old age, doing so
by instinct rather than reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy had just struck out for shore when
there came a shout, and two bicycle riders appeared,
followed by an elderly man on horseback.</p>

<p class='c000'>The elderly man was very much excited and
waved one hand wildly over his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Save Bessie!" he yelled. "Save my daughter!"</p>

<p class='c000'>And then dismounting, he attempted to leap
into the stream, but one of the bicyclists held
him back.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll bring her in," called out Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Papa! papa!" cried the little girl. "I want
my papa!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly but surely Bob neared the bank of the
river. The elderly man was close at hand, and
the instant he was able to do so he caught his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>child by the arm and raised her up. "Thank
God!" he murmured hoarsely, and strained the
little one to his breast, while the tears started to
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the bicycle riders gave Bob a hand, and
almost exhausted, the lad was drawn up to a
place of safety. He tried to stand up, but could
not, and sank down on the sward.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime the horses had come up and
were plunging wildly, close to the wreck of the
carriage. Both were on their sides, but presently
one raised himself to a swimming position
and struck out for the shore, dragging his
mate and the wreck after him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bicyclist, who up to this point had done
nothing, now ran forward, and as the horse
came closer he caught the animal by the curb,
and soon both steeds were safe, although each
was bruised by hoof strokes received from the
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your horses are all right now," said the
wheelman, as he cut the team loose from the
carriage, and tied them fast to a nearby palm
tree. The carriage was fastened to the river
bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never mind the horses—it is my child I was
thinking of," responded the elderly man. He
turned to Bob. "Young man, you have done
me a great service—a very great service, indeed."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>"Bessie is all wet," put in the little girl.
"And so is that boy, papa. We want dry clothing."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, yes, child, you shall go back to the hotel
directly. But first I must reward this brave
young man for what he has done."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Thank you, but I am not looking for a reward,
sir," answered Bob, frankly. "I am glad
that I was able to be of assistance."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are as generous as you are brave; I can
see that. May I ask your name?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Robert Hobart; although all my friends call
me Bob."</p>

<p class='c000'>"My name is Garrison Grey, and this is my
only child, Bessie. I am glad to know you,
Robert, and I'll not forget you; rest assured of
that. Do you live here?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, no; I'm from a place away up North, and
just came in on a yacht with some of my friends.
We are off on a summer cruise to Porto Rico."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Porto Rico! Why, I am in business in that
island," cried Garrison Grey.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then perhaps we'll meet in Porto Rico," returned
Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is true; and if we do, rest assured that
I will do what I can to entertain you. I live
and do business in Ponce, and here is my card,"
and Mr. Grey handed over the pasteboard, which
showed that he was in the wholesale coffee business.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>By this time Don came up on a run, anxious
to know the result of the runaway.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was an adventure and no mistake," he observed,
after he had been introduced and Bob
had told his tale. "As soon as I caught sight
of the river I was afraid you had all been
drowned."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Grey was stopping at the Grand Hotel,
and he insisted that the two boys accompany
him to the place, and be introduced to his wife.
Then he followed Bob and Don down to where
the Dashaway was taking on the last of her
stores, and was invited on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly a fine craft," he observed, as he
was taken around. "She ought to stand the
trip to Porto Rico very well. What place do
you expect to stop at first?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We haven't decided that point yet," answered
Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, don't forget to come to Ponce sooner
or later. I will be at home very shortly—as
soon as my business in St. Augustine is finished.
I am going to take several friends with me."</p>

<p class='c000'>In less than an hour the anchor of the yacht
was pulled up and the sails set, and off they
glided down the smooth river, Garrison Grey
waving them an adieu from the dock.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A fine man," mused Bob. "I hope we do
meet again."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>"We'll have to stop at Ponce before we leave
the island," answered Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so they parted with the coffee merchant,
little dreaming of the curious future meeting
in store for the merchant and themselves.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> SAVING THE TRAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For several days the weather proved delightful,
and as the wind was strong and steady the
Dashaway made rapid progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>All felt in the best of spirits, and with fishing
and telling stories the time passed as quickly as
could reasonably be expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys soon learned that Robert Menden
was a great story-teller, and never tired of sitting
around him when he was spinning one of
his yarns.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day they were talking of bicycle riding,
when the young Englishman shook his head
slowly. "No more riding for me," he said. "I
have had enough and to spare of it. I once came
close to losing my life in England through it—when
I was out with a friend named Rexwell.
I'll never forget that adventure."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tell us of it!" shouted several of the boys at
once; and sitting in a cozy corner of the deck,
Robert Menden told his story as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Rexwell and I were two days out from
Orelle in the heart of England. We were following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the smooth, winding road which leads
from Paxton to Riley's, and which crosses the
K. T. &amp; B. railway at half a dozen or more
points.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Rexwell had proposed the bicycle tour, as
being different from the ordinary run of outings,
and as I was on the lookout for excitement
of any sort, I eagerly agreed to join him in a
trip to last the best part of a week, never dreaming
of all that was to follow in the shape of a
close shave from death.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We both rode our favorite wheels, which, fortunately,
were of the same make, thus doing
away with the possibility of any dispute regarding
the superiority of either. To our handle
bars we had strapped a decidedly limited
amount of baggage; our pocketbooks were sufficiently
filled to meet all wants in that direction,
and as both of us were in the best of health and
free from worldly care, we went speeding along
the highway in the best of spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Sixteen miles to Midland Cut,' sang out
Rexwell, as he slowed up at a guideboard placed
where a wagon trail crossed the road. 'We
ought to be able to make that by supper time
with ease.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'It looks to me as if there was a hill back of
yonder woods,' I replied, as I took a long look
ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>"'It can't be much of a climb, or we would see
it over the treetops, Bert. We'll soon know,'
he went on, as he forged ahead by an extra spurt,
giving me some quick work on the pedals to
catch up to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a little after four in the afternoon, or
evening, as the residents of some localities termed
it. The fore part of the day had been somewhat
oppressive, the usual southwest breeze having
died down by ten o'clock, leaving the glaring
sun its full sway. Now I noticed a dense mass
of clouds creeping and rolling up from over to
our right, and drew Rexwell's attention to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'By Jove! that looks as if we were going to
have a storm, Robert,' said he. 'Those clouds
are rolling up fast, too. We must strike shelter
before we get wet to the skin.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"We crossed the polished tracks of the railroad
and descended into the woods. The road
was not sufficiently used to clear it of its overhanging
branches, which more than once struck
us in the face as we bowled along. Before the
heavy growth was passed, the sun was obscured,
and we heard the distant roll of thunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We pressed on faster than ever, only to find
ourselves at the foot of an extra steep hill, at the
entrance to another dense patch of timber.
Here the way was rather soft, and we were glad
enough, after a few minutes more of riding, to
leap down and trundle our wheels beside us.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>"Pat, pat, pat, patter, patter! It was the rain,
striking the leaves overhead, and soon some
came down upon our heads. Up at the top
of the hill was an opening, and there the drops
seemed to be coming down in a deluge. The
thunder now increased, accompanied by occasional
flashes of lightning.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'We're in for it, old man,' said Rexwell, dismally.
'What had we best do? seek shelter
among the trees?'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'If you're not afraid of being struck by
lightning,' I replied; and then the pair of us
made a break to where a clump of trees stood,
their branches tightly interlaced. This spot
reached, we crouched down in a hollow, and I
brought out my rubber blanket and made of it
an apology for a tent, by throwing it over our
bicycles.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hardly had we become settled than we heard
the sounds of horses' hoofs on the road. Looking
forth we beheld four horsemen dash into
view. All were drenched with rain and one was
muttering savagely at his ill-luck.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Come on in here, boys; we can stay under
the trees until the worst is over,' we heard the
leader of the quartet remark; and he turned in
not fifty feet from where we crouched.
'Ricketts, be sure and keep that dynamite dry,'
he added, to the man who had been doing all
the grumbling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>"'Oh, that's all right—I wish I was as dry,'
responded Ricketts. 'Hang such a night as this
is going to be!'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'You're crazy, man, to grumble,' put in a
third of the party. 'Why, we couldn't have it
better. The railroad people will never be able
to follow us.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'That's all you know about it, Larson. Mud
leaves an ugly trail,' growled Ricketts. 'Ain't
that so, Shorer?'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'We can follow the creek from Weemer's,
and that will throw 'em off the scent,' responded
the leader. 'All we'll have to do is to stop the
train this side of Blowfen's instead of the other.
By the way, keep your ears open for Jamison
and the others. We don't want them to go below
Blowfen's by mistake.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'I'm watching, all right,' said Larson.
'Ain't he got my gun?'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Yes, and Lewis promised to bring me some .42
cartridges, too,' said Ricketts. 'Refley sold
me a lot of .38's by mistake. When will the express
get to Blowfen's?'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Eight-fifteen, or thereabouts. We must be
on the watch at eight,' came from the leader of
the quartet. 'And I want every one of you to
do the right thing. If you don't, that twenty
thousand will slip through our fingers, and we
may get our necks stretched instead.'</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>"A clap of thunder broke off the conversation
at this point, and when the reverberations
rolled away, it was not resumed. The horsemen
had gathered under some trees to the right of
us, and now occupied their time in watching for
their comrades and in examining the arms and
other traps which they carried.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I had listened to their talk in rising horror,
and the clutch Rexwell took upon my arm told
me plainly that he was not less affected. As
the thunder died away, he whispered hoarsely
into my ear: 'Train wreckers!'</p>

<p class='c000'>"I looked at him and nodded. 'They are going
to wreck the express to-night, too,' I added
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'We must stop them.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, that was plainly our duty. But how
was the deed to be accomplished? We were
only two to four, or more, and our small pocket
arms would prove of small value should we expose
ourselves and provoke a 'mix-up.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'That Shorer is the notorious train wrecker
from Scotland,' said Rexwell. 'There is a reward
up for his capture, I think.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Let's effect his capture, and collar the reward,'
I cried eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Hush, Robert! Collar the reward! If
they found us here they wouldn't hesitate to
fill us full of holes. That Shorer is as cold-blooded
as they make them.'</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>"'If we could get away without being seen,
we might ride back to Wheatland and inform
the authorities.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Providing we could get there before the express
goes through.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'To do that, we'll have to get out at once.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"A noise on the road made us break off. The
rest of the train wrecker's gang were coming
up—six stalwart and bronzed men, each on a
powerful horse, and all heavily armed. The ten
horsemen made an imposing cavalcade.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Silently I took down the rubber blanket and
rolled it up, strapping it fast in its place. Seeing
this, Rexwell felt of his machine and examined
the pedals and running gear.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Follow me,' I whispered; and lifting my
bicycle from the hollow, I darted behind the
clump of cottonwoods, and hurried through the
woods in a direction parallel to the highway.
My chum came close behind me. Inside of ten
minutes we were several hundred feet away, and
then we turned into the road, mounted to our
saddles, and pedalled down the back track as
rapidly as our weary legs and the state of the
muddy highway would permit. Once we fancied
we heard a shout from behind, but we never
looked back and nothing followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was still raining; not as heavily as before,
but still sufficiently to reach our skins and render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>us far from comfortable. The wet bushes
and tree branches slashed in our faces, and
twice both of us ran into hollows and took nasty
headers. But we minded nothing of it all, our
one thought being to get to Wheatland ahead
of the express. If we failed, we could well imagine
what dreadful consequences would follow.
If any one was killed in the hold-up, we would
consider ourselves little short of being murderers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On, on, and still on we sped, the cold perspiration
mixing with the rain on our necks and
faces, our hearts beating wildly and our breath
coming heavily. We were fagged out, yet we
must keep on and cover the fourteen miles which
still lay between us and the nearest stopping
place of the express on the K. T. &amp; B. railway.</p>

<p class='c000'>"As we reached the top of a hill and sped like
rockets down the opposite slope, Rexwell forged
ahead in a truly reckless fashion. I had just
started to call to him to be careful, when I
heard a crash, saw his machine bounce up in the
air, and he went sailing into a lot of brush.
Luckily I avoided the rock he had struck, and
slowing up as quickly as possible, I dismounted
and went to his assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The wind had been knocked out of him, but
no bones were broken, and when I reached his
side he was struggling to rise, his face and hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>scratched in a dozen places, from which the
blood streamed freely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'How's my bike?' were his first words; and I
picked the machine up, to discover the front
tire collapsed and the wheel twisted in two
places.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'That settles it; I can't ride any further to-night,'
he groaned. 'You'll have to go it alone,
Robert.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'And leave you?' I answered, quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Yes, why not? I can take care of myself.
I'll get to Wheatland somehow, by morning. Or
you can send a horse and wagon out to meet me.
Now, hurry up.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"It would have been useless to argue with
Rexwell, even had I felt inclined to do so, which
was not the case; so with a cheering word, I
went on alone through the wet and the gathering
darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a solitary ride I shall never forget.
I stopped once at the foot of a second hill, to
light my lamp, and that was the only time I
dismounted until I wheeled into the outskirts
of Wheatland, panting for breath, my eyes bulging
out of their sockets from the tremendous
strain to which they had been subjected in the
gloom, and my legs aching so greatly that I
could scarcely stand upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Show me the nearest way to the depot,' I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>cried to the first person I met; and receiving the
directions, sped on through the mud until the
end of the long platform was reached. With
awful distinctness I heard the clear whistle of
an incoming locomotive, and heard the clanging
of the bell. It was the express sliding into
the station. I fairly tumbled from my bicycle
and lumbered forward as the long train slowed
up. The engineer was looking back from his
seat in the cab, as I came closer and called to
him:</p>

<p class='c000'>"'For heaven's sake, don't go ahead yet!' I
gasped. 'You'll be wrecked if you do.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'What's that?' he cried, and as I repeated
my words he leaped down and caught me by
the arm. I was soon surrounded by a crowd,
consisting of the engineer, fireman, conductor
and half a dozen of the train and station hands.
Everyone listened to my story with close attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Hank Shorer means to keep his word,' said
the engineer. 'He vowed four years ago to do
me and the express. Where's the head constable?'</p>

<p class='c000'>"The officer was not at hand, but soon a posse
of men from town were marshalled together under
the leadership of the conductor, a man of
fifty, with an iron will and, so I was told by an
outsider, one who could shoot as straight as
anybody in the country.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>"Tired out as I was, I still could not resist
the temptation to board the train as a passenger,
after sending a man with a wagon back for
Rexwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We pulled out of the station with exactly
twenty-six armed men on board. In the cab
were the engineer and the fireman, each with a
rifle at his elbow. It was still raining, although
not as heavily as before.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Down the glistening tracks pounded big No.
657, which had drawn the express for three
years. Women and children had been left behind,
and the face of each man bore a look of
determination and alertness. They meant to
teach the train wreckers a severe lesson, and,
if possible, break up the notorious gang which
had terrorized the country for many months.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The flash of a red light ahead! It was the
signal to halt. The engineer set his teeth. One
hand went to the lever, the other to the gun.
The struggle was at hand. The long train
slowed up, and came to a halt fifty feet ahead
of the spot where the danger signal had been
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Up with your hands there!' came the command
from two masked men, who leaped aboard
the tender and faced those in the cab. At the
same instant the remainder of the gang surrounded
the train and began to board the cars.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>"A single shot rang out, followed by a dozen
reports. Then came groans and more shots.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'We've been betrayed!' yelled a voice from
beside the coach in which I stood. 'Make for
the hosses, boys!'</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was the voice of Shorer. Hardly had he
uttered the command, than the conductor of the
train took careful aim at the man and pulled the
trigger of his heavy rifle. There was a shriek,
a half-leap into the misty air, and the career of
the most notorious train wrecker in that section
was closed forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I was not left undisturbed. At the beginning
of the encounter a bullet had shattered the
window glass beside me. In return for this I
used my own weapon, and succeeded in wounding
one of the gang outside, in the leg. Five
others were wounded, and the remainder ran off
as fast as they could to where their horses were
tethered in a nearby grove.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'To the horses!' cried one of the posse from
Wheatland, and a rush was made for the express
coach, in which half a dozen trusty animals
had been brought along. A gangplank was put
out, the horses brought forth, and in less than
three minutes the riders were in the saddle and
in hot pursuit of the fleeing criminals.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The dead body of Shorer was picked up and
taken on board, along with his wounded comrades.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>On the run back to town one of the
wounded men died. The others were taken to
the county jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By the time Rexwell arrived, I had cooled
off somewhat, although I was still far from
being thoroughly calm. Both of us were surrounded,
and we had to tell our story from beginning
to end.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By nightfall of the next day the horsemen
came back with two additional prisoners, who
were also jailed. The others of the gang escaped
for the time, though I have since heard
that they were captured out in Wales.</p>

<p class='c000'>"For the part we had played in the memorable
incident narrated, Rexwell and I were well
rewarded, both by the railroad and the express
company. But, while the reward was a highly
acceptable one, I had no desire for another such
adventure while touring on my wheel."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> A FIRE AT SEA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Well, that's one of the greatest bicycle
stories I ever heard!" cried Dick, when Robert
Menden had concluded. "I reckon those train
wreckers deserved their fate."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't like to think of the affair, to tell the
truth," replied the Englishman. "For a good
many nights after it happened I scarcely slept
a wink."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I believe you," put in Leander. "No wonder
you gave up wheeling. Anyway, it isn't as
popular in England as it is here, is it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hardly; although you see more wheels in
England every day," concluded Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Jacob had listened to the story with as
much interest as any of the boys. "Tell ye
what," he said, reflectively, "he kin spin a
yarn slicker nor most sailors kin, an' thet's saying
a whole lot," and Dick agreed with the old
tar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day as the wind died down a bit, the
boys went fishing in earnest. They used several
kinds of bait, and were rewarded with several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>bass, two bluefish and several other specimens
of the finny tribe, all of which were turned
over to Danny.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dat's enough fish fer a week," was the Irish
lad's comment. "Ain't dat bluefish a stunner!"
and he held up the catch which had been brought
in on Leander's line. The bluefish was done to
a turn for supper, and never had anything
tasted more delicious.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys had brought their faithful old dog,
Dash, along, and this animal came in for a good
share of attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You see, we couldn't think of leaving him behind,"
explained Dick to the Englishman.
"He went with us on that other outing, and he's
as much a member of the club as Danny or any
of us;" and Dash stood by, and wagged his tail,
as if he understood perfectly what was being
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dash and Dashaway!" laughed Robert Menden.
"A good pair, truly;" and he patted the
canine on the back. Dash took this very soberly,
for he was rather slow in making new friends.
But once a friend was made, the dog would stick
to him through thick and thin, as Robert Menden
found out later on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Jacob and the others had studied the
chart closely, and a direct course had been
mapped out for San Juan, the capital city of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Porto Rico, situated nearly in the center of the
northern coast. This course would take them
close to the great Bahama Bank and past many
of the Bahama Islands.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are you sure you know the course?" questioned
Dick of the old tar. "You know we don't
want to be smashed up on some hidden rock."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know every mile of the way," returned old
Jacob. "Don't ye fear, lad, but what I'll git ye
through in safety;" and this speech relieved
Dick a good deal, for he understood only too
well how dangerous were the waters they were
now sailing.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they proceeded on their course, the boys
questioned Robert Menden regarding the location
of the caves, one which was supposed to
contain the treasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They are almost directly south of San Juan,"
said the Englishman. "The distance must be
twenty or twenty-five miles. I think we can
learn all we want to know on that score when we
reach San Juan."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, we can't get there any too quick for
me," put in Bob. "I'm just crazy to locate that
money box."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I understand there is a grand military road
from San Juan on the north to Ponce on the
south," observed Leander. "The road travels
over mountains over four thousand feet high.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>More than likely this road passes near the big
caves."</p>

<p class='c000'>For two days the wind blew at a lively rate
and then toward night it seemed to die out utterly.
They were now down to 24° north latitude,
and the atmosphere was stifling.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Finding that treasure is going to be hot
work," observed Dick, as he mixed glasses of
iced lemonade for himself and the others. "I
reckon we'll earn what we get."</p>

<p class='c000'>"How would you like to sail up to the frozen
North?" suggested Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, we stood the ice and snow all right
enough last winter."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So we did. But still, I don't mind this so
very much."</p>

<p class='c000'>By nine o'clock in the evening all hands were
ready to retire. But it was Bob's trick on deck,
and after receiving careful instructions from old
Jacob as to how he should keep the yacht headed,
he was left to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no moon, but the sky was clear,
and countless stars shone down upon the
polished deck of the Dashaway, so that everything
could be seen quite clearly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Four hours of this will just about do me,"
thought Bob. He did not wish to own up to
being sleepy, and to keep his eyes open he began
to whistle softly to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>It was nearly eleven o'clock when the whistle
died out and the boy gave a long yawn. Oh, if
his trick would only come to an end! He
knew that once in his bunk he would go fast
asleep in less than a minute.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few minutes more passed, and the tired boy
leaned up against the brass-bound wheel. Then
he straightened up and tried to whistle again.
But the note died on his lips and then—he knew
no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bump! The shock awoke everybody on
board, but no one quicker than old Jacob, who
slept, as Dick expressed it, "with one eye open."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's the matter?" roared the Yankee tar,
as he tumbled on deck, minus his shoes and the
greater portion of his wearing apparel. "By
gosh, Bob, ye air running her on the rocks!"
and he ran with might and main for the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shock had also aroused Bob, but the
youth was too bewildered for a few seconds to
do more than stare helplessly about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why—er—what—" he began, when the sight
of a long line of breakers, coming over some hidden
rocks dead ahead, almost paralyzed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He tried to throw the Dashaway over to starboard
and then over to port, and the consequence
of the two movements was to send the
craft straight ahead as before.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Down with the mainsail!" roared old Jacob,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and took the wheel from Bob. Then came a
second bump, as the yacht slid up in the air over
another rock. By this time all were on deck,
only to be thrown headlong in several directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>But each of the party understood that life
or death depended upon his movements, and the
mainsail came down with a bang. By this time
the Yankee tar had the Dashaway well over to
port, and he kept her hard down until she
seemed to be turning a circle. The water was
now boiling all around them, and a third shock
was felt, although this was but a slight one.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can we get out of it?" whispered Bob. He
could scarcely trust himself to speak. "If we
go down it will be my fault!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can try," returned old Jacob, shortly.
"Now help put that mainsail up again."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob jumped in with a will, and as the canvas
filled, a long tack was made, and the Dashaway
proceeded to the south of the angry breakers
and the rocks which had almost lured her to her
doom. The boys and Robert Menden held their
breath for fully a minute, when old Jacob announced
that immediate danger was past.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How in the name of goodness did ye steer
in thar?" demanded the Yankee tar, when he
felt in the humor to speak. "I didn't tell ye to
do it."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>"I—I—" Bob hung his head. "I'm afraid I
dozed over the wheel, Jacob. I was terribly
tired."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dozed!" roared the old tar. "Bob Hobart,
I'm ashamed on ye, thet's what I am. Dozed!
An' the Dashaway going ahead full split, ready
to knock the hull bottom out on the rocks.
Dozed! Well, don't ye ever do it ag'in, thet's
all!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I never will, Jacob; rest assured of that,"
pleaded Bob. "I should have called somebody."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Thet's it." The old tar turned to the crowd
about him. "No dozing over the wheel after
this," he said, sternly. "The fust one to do it
gits—gits——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gets fined five dollars and his dinner,"
finished Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He ought to have the lash," growled old
Jacob. "We can't afford to allow it, nohow."</p>

<p class='c000'>And it was several days before he could fully
forgive Bob for his thoughtless action. My
young readers can rest assured that no one on
board ever dozed over the steering wheel again,
day or night, whether they were close to shore
or many miles out to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since throwing in his fortunes with them,
Robert Menden had become quite a seaman, and
he was always ready to do any work assigned
to him. He liked to steer, and often took one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of the boy's places if that individual wished to
do something else.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I was brought up to work," he said; "and
this life on the ocean wave just suits me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I like it myself," smiled Dick. "Still, I
can't say that I would care to tie myself down
to a sailor's life."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor me, for the matter of that. But such a
trip as this is very nice."</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly a week slipped by, and they were well
on their journey, when Danny was taken sick.
He was not bad enough to be in bed, but still
he went about his work listlessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm afther thinkin' I want a sight o' land,"
he said, with a sickly smile. "I wasn't cut out
fer no jack tar, not me."</p>

<p class='c000'>That night old Jacob was left at the wheel,
the Yankee tar having slept the greater part of
the afternoon and evening. It was a blustery
night, yet Dick, who was very tired, went to
sleep with scarcely an effort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Jacob had been left on deck alone less
than half an hour, when a howl from Dash
aroused him. The dog came toward him and
repeated the howl, in the most dismal fashion
imaginable.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is it, old fellow?" questioned the Yankee.
"There is no moon to bay at. Are ye
gittin' sick to keep Danny company?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>At this the dog set up a worse howl than ever,
and then pointed his long nose in the direction
of the galley. Old Jacob looked in the direction
and saw a thin curl of smoke issuing
through one of the windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Jee-rusalem!" ejaculated the Yankee. In
a twinkle he had fastened the wheel and was
running to the galley with all speed. As he
ran, Dash gave a loud bark, glad that he had
been understood. One glance into the galley
was enough for Jacob Ropes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Fire! fire!" he bawled, with all the strength
of his powerful lungs. "Tumble on deck, boys;
the Dashaway is on fire!"</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> FIGHTING THE FLAMES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Old Jacob's loud cries soon aroused everybody.
The first person to come up from below
was Don, who looked as pale as a sheet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is the yacht afire?" he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The galley is," returned the old tar. "We've
got to work lively if we want to save the Dashaway.
Come; man the hose pump, while I get
some buckets. And some of ye lower the sails.
To run into this wind will only feed the flames."</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time all the others were on deck, even
Danny coming up, his head bound around with
a towel.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's in de galley!" he groaned. "I t'ought
dat fire was most out!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He, too, ran for water, and so did Dick, while
Leander and Bob began to work, first on the
mainsail and then the jib, which, in less than
two minutes were safely stowed away, although
in a hasty, clumsy fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luckily the hose pump was handy, and soon
a small stream was pouring into the galley from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the window, the door having in the meantime
been tightly closed, so that the fire might obtain
no draught to feed upon. Then came old
Jacob with some extra buckets, and a bucket
brigade was formed by the old tar and Robert
Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was hot work, and it must be confessed that
everybody was thoroughly scared, feeling that
if the fire once got beyond the galley, the yacht
would be doomed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what will become of us, then?" whispered
Dick to Don. "We're completely out of
sight of land."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If the wust comes to the wust, we'll fill the
small boat with provisions and take to that,"
said old Jacob. "But I think we can master
these flames yet."</p>

<p class='c000'>The sparks were now pouring from the windows
of the galley at a lively rate, and soon a
bright column of flame shot up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dat's de pot uf grease!" groaned Danny.
"I was so sick I didn't t'ink to put it away."</p>

<p class='c000'>He was laboring as hard as any of them,
working the hose pump with Don, who felt
ready to drop with exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll go down in the hold and see if it's eating
through the floor," said old Jacob, and disappeared
through the hatchway.</p>

<p class='c000'>All waited anxiously for what he might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>to say. They heard him crawling about with
care.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No fire yet," he yelled. "But plenty of
smoke. Work lively, an' keep it up, lads!"
And then all hands went at it with renewed
vigor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inside of five minutes their labors began to
show some effect. The flames died away and
only the thick smoke continued to pour from the
galley.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All of you fill your buckets, and then I'll
open the door," said Dick, and his instructions
were followed. At the draught a slight flame
went up, but a single douse of water put it out;
and then the conflagration was practically over.</p>

<p class='c000'>But neither old Jacob nor any of the others
were satisfied, and procuring a patch of old canvas,
the Yankee tar soaked it thoroughly and
then went into the galley alone and beat out all
of the remaining sparks. Then lanterns were
lit, and all hands took turns at inspecting the
damage which had been done.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's not so great as I thought," said Dick.
"The stove is all right, and all we'll have to do
is to put up some new boarding on the sides and
ceiling. But wasn't it a narrow shave!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's what it was," answered Don, soberly.
"I don't want another like it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor I," added Bob, and Leander shook his
head doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>"I wonder how it started," was Robert Menden's
question. "Danny, can you explain it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sure an' I can't, sur, savin' to say that I was
sick, an' maybe I didn't put the fire out very
good, sur;" and Danny looked as if he had committed
the greatest crime on earth. The origin
of the fire was never fully explained, but probably
Danny's view of it was correct.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fire brought forth another lecture from
old Jacob. "Ye can't be too careful, nohow,"
he said. "Ye want to see to it thet not a spark
is allowed around. If the Dashaway had been
burnt up, like as not most of us would have lost
our lives."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sure we'll all be careful in the future,"
said Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You kin bet I'll be on me guard, so I will,"
broke in Danny. "Dat fire most scared me into
a fit, dat's wot it did."</p>

<p class='c000'>The nights were now beautiful ones. A
cloudless sky and millions of stars twinkled
down upon the polished deck of the Dashaway
as she bowled along before a steady breeze,
which old Jacob declared was "jest about right,
any way o' lookin' at it." It was cool, too, for
that locality, and the balance of the trip promised
to prove a most delightful one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing along the Great Bahama Bank to the
south of the Andros Islands, the course had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>toward Acklin Island, on the southeast, and
then past Providence Island, straight onward
to a course five or six miles north of the upper
coast of Hayti and Dominica.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We might stop along the coast o' Dominica,"
observed old Jacob, one day, as he surveyed the
distant coast line with his long telescope.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wouldn't stop unless it is necessary for
stores," returned Robert Menden. "Remember,
we want to get to Porto Rico just as quickly
as possible."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have stores enough to last us to San
Juan. I saw to thet afore we pulled up anchor
at St. Augustine."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then we'll go right straight through," decided
Dick; and as he was the owner of the
Dashaway, that settled the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>But going right straight through was not such
an easy matter as anticipated. Early on the
following day a heavy fog set in, and by noon
it was so thick that one could not see twenty
feet ahead. At once old Jacob ordered the jib
taken in, also the topsail, while the mainsail
was closely reefed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is one o' the wust places in the world
fer a fog," was the Yankee tar's comment.
"Afore ye know it if we ain't careful we'll run
on a hidden bank. We must keep a strict
watch, and keep the fog horn blowing until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>fog lifts." And this was done, one and another
taking his turn at the big horn until he was
tired. Once, about seven o'clock, they heard
an answering horn, which seemed to come closer
and closer, but just as they felt they had good
cause for alarm, the sound began to recede, until
it was lost in the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is reg'lar smugglers' weather," said old
Jacob. "They love it, for they can land goods
'most anywhere, without the custom house
officials being the wiser."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did you ever run across any smugglers?"
questioned Don, who stood by.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I did once—down on the coast o' Maine.
They were bringin' in silk from Chiny, and I
helped the revenue officers collar, six o' 'em—strappin'
big fellers, too. Three o' the crowd
were shot in the mix-up and one o' 'em died in
the hospital from his wounds. It was in that
muss that I got that," and the old sailor pointed
to a long scar along his neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Excuse me, but I want nothing to do with
smugglers," shuddered Don. "They must be a
bloodthirsty set."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Some o' 'em are, lad—yet they ain't half so
bad as the wreckers—the chaps as sets up false
lights along shore to lure a vessel to her doom, so
as they kin loot her. Those are the chaps as
ought to be hung, every mother's son on 'em!"
and old Jacob shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>It was not until thirty hours had gone by that
the fog began to lift, raised by a gentle breeze
which sent the Dashaway on her course as lively
as ever before.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Off once more!" shouted Bob. "Hurrah!"
and the others joined in the cheer. It was calculated
that two days more would bring them
within eight of Porto Rico, at a point near
Manati, a city located directly in the center of
the northern coast, and but a few miles to the
westward of San Juan.</p>

<p class='c000'>But once again their hopes were doomed to
disappointment. The wind lasted only until
sunrise the next morning, then died out utterly,
leaving the sun to boil down on the deck with
more fierceness than it had shown for some time.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Confound the luck!" growled Dick, as he
gazed at the idle sails of his craft. "I wonder
how long this is going to last."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why not whistle for a breeze," suggested
Bob, slyly. "I've heard that will fetch it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All right, Bob, you whistle," replied Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll tell you what I'd like to do," said Don.
"I'd like to take a swim before we go ashore at
San Juan."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hurrah! just the thing!" cried Leander,
throwing up his cap. "We'll all go in together!"
And he rushed down to the cabin, to
don his bathing trunks. All of the other boys
followed, even Danny taking part.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.<br /> A SWIM NOT LIKELY TO BE FORGOTTEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"You want to be on the lookout fer sharks,"
observed old Jacob, as he watched the boys'
preparations.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious! Do you mean to say there are
sharks around here?" ejaculated Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't see any, but there may be, nevertheless.
Howsomever, I'll keep my weather eye
open an' give ye warnin', if I see anything suspicious."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't want any sharks in mine," put in
Don, and hesitated a long while before entering
the ocean. But when he saw the others diving
about and having a good time, he could not resist
the temptation to join them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was jolly sport. The water was just warm
enough to be pleasant, and the waves were so
light that there was little or no danger of being
pounded against the yacht's sides. They dove
and turned somersaults to their hearts' content,
and then Dick proposed a race, and an empty
barrel was thrown out behind the Dashaway.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/p081.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>"Each boy must swim to the right of the barrel
and around it," cried out Robert Menden.
"An extra piece of pie to the lad touching the
rudder first on the return. Line up now. All
ready?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes! yes!" was the cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then go!" And away went the five boys,
shrieking and laughing wildly, while Robert
Menden and old Jacob watched the sport with
keen interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The barrel had floated all of a hundred and
fifty feet away, so the race would be one of over
a hundred yards. At first Dick was in the lead,
but gradually Leander crawled up, with Bob,
Don and Danny not far behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm goin' to win dis race if I kin!" gasped
the chubby Irish lad. "Dat extry pie is comin'
to me, even if I has ter make it meself!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, Danny, you'll make the pie for me!"
laughed Bob, and forged ahead of all of the
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the turning point Bob led, with Leander,
Dick, Don and Danny close behind. But now
Leander began to play out, and at the barrel
he paused for a second to gain his breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then something awful happened—something
that Leander will never forget as long as
he lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something cold and slimy brushed up against
his legs and swiftly encircled them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>What the thing was, Leander could not imagine;
but the yell he gave would have shamed
an Indian on the war-path.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Get out!" were his words, and he tried to
kick the thing off; but his efforts were unavailing,
and whatever it was, it drew about his legs
closer and closer and then started to drag him
under the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>He yelled again; but his chums were too intent
upon winning the race to pay much attention
to him. "Come on, don't lag behind!"
called out Dick. "You may win yet."</p>

<p class='c000'>Before anybody noticed that something was
wrong, Bob had reached the rudder post and
had won. But now old Jacob was on his feet,
and pointing excitedly to where Leander was
clutching at the empty barrel and yelling at the
top of his lungs.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Somethin' is wrong with the lad," said the
old Yankee tar.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Help! help!" screamed the terrified boy.
"Something has me by the legs and is trying to
pull me under!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is it possible!" cried Robert Menden. He
turned to the old sailor. "What can it be?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't know—maybe a devil-fish," was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Help! don't leave me to die!" came from
Leander. He had slipped from the barrel, but
now he clutched it once more.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>As quickly as he could, old Jacob procured a
life line and threw it toward the lad.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the line fell short and Leander gave another
scream.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Throw me a long knife, and I'll try to help
him," said Dick. "He shan't perish if I can
help him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, no, boy; it may cost you your life,"
shuddered Robert Menden. "All of you had
better come on board as quickly as you can."</p>

<p class='c000'>But none of the members of the Gun and
Sled Club would listen to this. They had stuck
together before in extreme peril, and they would
do the same again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Keep up; we are coming!" shouted Dick,
and having procured a long kitchen knife he
swam toward Leander with all speed. Soon
the others had armed themselves in a similar
fashion and were following. Even faithful old
Dash seemed to realize that something was
wrong, and with a loud splash he, too, went over
the yacht's side.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They have grit, as you Americans would
say," observed Robert Menden. "What do you
think it is?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll know in a minit," replied old Jacob,
and rushed for a gun.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time poor Leander was utterly exhausted.
The thing about his legs was growing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>tighter and tighter and pulling downward
so heavily that the barrel to which the boy clung
was almost totally submerged.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Save me!" he gasped once more. "I'm going
down! It's pulling me under!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm coming!" answered Dick. "What is
it? Can't you make out?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Something slippery and slimy. Oh, save
me!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"If it was a devil-fish we'd see something of
it," thought Dick, and he dashed in and then
under water. In a moment he had hold of
Leander's legs and was slashing away vigorously
with his knife—at a mass of drifting seaweed!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a tough job; but once Dick knew he had
not some animal to contend with, or monster
of the deep, he grew calmer, and in a minute
more Leander was free, and the others were
helping him back to the yacht.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick brought with him some of the seaweed,
which was dark green in color and covered with
a whitish slime which gave one a shiver to
touch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Leander was too exhausted to stand,
upon reaching the deck, and had to be assisted
to the cabin, where he was rubbed down and put
to bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>All on board examined the seaweed with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>"It's alive; don't ye forgit thet," observed old
Jacob. "An' if Leander hadn't been cut away
by Dick, he would have been pulled under, jest
as sartin as if he had been tied to a rope. Sometimes
thet seaweed covered an acre or more of
the ocean. I don't know wot the scientific
name is, but us old sailors used to call it Old
Nick's hot-bed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And a hot-bed it must make," put in Don.
"I don't think I want to go swimming around
here again."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The weed winds around anything that it happens
to touch, and then it begins to contract,
and that pulls the thing down. Many a poor
sailor has lost his life through foolin' with Old
Nick's hot-bed," concluded old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the day following, the breeze freshened
once more, and the Dashaway bowled along
merrily. Toward evening all hands began to
watch for land, but it did not appear. Yet
about nine o'clock in the evening they sighted
numerous lights clustered together almost
directly south of the yacht.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Must be the lights of Manati," observed old
Jacob; and his surmise proved correct, and by
morning they were running straight for the
harbor of San Juan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that the end of the long voyage was so
close at hand, the boys and Robert Menden were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>impatient to go ashore, and the time was spent
in making preparations for the trip to the great
caves near Caguas.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We may have some difficulty in taking our
guns ashore," said Dick. "In that case we'll
have to rely, perhaps, on our pistols."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You won't be hunters after game on this
trip," smiled Robert Menden. "You'll be after
something of greater value."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But we'll have to go armed," put in Bob.
"I've heard that Porto Rico is full of old-fashioned
Spanish brigands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There are brigands, but not as many as you
perhaps imagine," said the Englishman. "Our
greatest enemy will be Joseph Farvel—if he
turns up."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And he will surely appear sooner or later,"
said Don. "We had better be on our guard
against him and any followers he may have
picked up."</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> THE CLUB ARRIVES AT SAN JUAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Island of Porto Rico boasts of but three
cities of importance: San Juan on the north,
Mayaguez on the west and Ponce on the south.
The mountainous country back of the seacoast
is dotted with hundreds of villages and hamlets;
but the means of communication from one place
to another are very poor, the best highway being
the military road from San Juan to Ponce, a
splendid bit of engineering, which, as previously
mentioned, runs over mountains nearly, if not
all, of four thousand feet high.</p>

<p class='c000'>San Juan, the capital, is the principal city,
especially so far as shipping is concerned, for
its harbor is one of the best the island affords.
The city contains about 30,000 inhabitants; natives,
Spaniards and negroes, and foreigners
from all over the world. It is wedged in along
the shore, between two frowning forts of whitish
stone and a long line of battlements, once kept
in good order, but now fast tumbling into decay.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the city itself there are two plazas; one at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the city hall and the other near Fort Christobal—both
great meeting-places, in the evenings, for
native dames and maidens, young and old men,
and children. It is a merry crowd, that smokes,
sings, dances, listens to the band, and otherwise
amuses itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Dashaway came to anchor in the harbor,
all the boys viewed the shore with interest.
They could see row after row of the flat, square
houses, set up in long blocks, with narrow and
not over clean streets between. About every
second house had its second story project over
the first, and balconies were to be found everywhere,
sometimes causing the street below to be
little better than a tunnel.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All ashore that's going!" cried old Jacob,
and the small boat was lowered, and the boys
and Robert Menden entered, along with their
weapons and other traps, and then the Yankee
sailor pulled them to the nearest dock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a harbor officer met them, and a long
conference ensued. Then the Dashaway was
visited by the San Juan officials and inspected,
after which the craft was assigned to a proper
position in the harbor. It was at first thought
to leave old Jacob in charge of the yacht; but
at the last moment a native was engaged to
watch the craft, and the Yankee went along
with "his boys," as he was wont to call them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>"Now, lads, are you all ready for the trip?"
questioned Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are," came in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Remember, you may have some dangers to
face. Don't go if you would rather remain behind."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who's afraid," came from Bob. "I'm not."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor I!" came from the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm out fer dat hundred dollars wot was
promised to me," put in Danny. "Just youse
lead de way an' I'll be close in yer footsteps, see
if I ain't."</p>

<p class='c000'>Each of the lads had provided himself with a
hunting suit, and a small pack containing a
change of underwear, comb and brush, and the
like. All carried a little money, which, in the
city, was exchanged for Spanish silver; for it
was correctly surmised that the natives in the
interior would not take United States coin.
To-day that is, of course, changed, and Uncle
Sam's coin or paper money is as good as any.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party of seven soon found themselves on
the main street of San Juan. Robert Menden
had made some careful inquiries, and without
delay they set off for Caguas.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had hired a native turnout to take them
to the place, but the driver failed to turn up,
and at last they set out on foot for the village.</p>

<p class='c000'>The many sights to be seen at every hand were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>very interesting. Here were the milk and fruit
peddlers, each with his wares hanging from a
yoke balanced over his broad shoulders. And
here were funny looking ponies and donkeys
with huge burdens strapped to their backs.
Native carts were rather scarce, but occasionally
one would come lumbering along, with its
broad and almost solid wheels, and its team of
oxen or cows. The driver would walk by the
team's side, lashing them with a long whip and
yelling at them continually in very bad Spanish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people also interested the boys. A large
proportion of them were black, the blacks increasing
in number as the seacoast was left behind.
Most of the colored men looked friendly
enough, but here and there could be found fellows
of mixed Carib blood—tall, ugly looking
creatures.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I reckon they are the Porto Rican brigands,"
whispered Dick, as they passed three of the ugly
looking Caribs. "I don't think I would care
to meet them of a dark night along a lonely
road."</p>

<p class='c000'>"These people have good cause to be ugly,"
put in Robert Menden. "Spain has robbed the
natives for years by taxing them to death, and
I understand that in many places the church
has fallen into disrepute because the clergy do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>everything they can to get the money away
from the sugar and plantation workers. It's
really a sad state of affairs."</p>

<p class='c000'>On they went, until San Juan was left behind
and they struck the military road previously
mentioned. The walking was all uphill, but
the ascent was so gradual that they scarcely
noticed it. On both sides of the road grew
tropical trees of all sorts—palms, mangoes,
guavas, cedar, mahogany, and that wood which
can be found almost anywhere—hemlock.
There were also plantains and great cacti, and
over all trailed immense tropical vines. Close
to the deep, black soil grew magnificent ferns,
and such mosses as the boys had never before
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Almost a paradise, isn't it?" remarked Don.
"And how clear the air is—not half as hot as I
imagined it would be."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Jest you wait until noon afore ye speak o'
the heat," returned old Jacob. "Old Sol don't
git to work in earnest till about twelve or one
o'clock."</p>

<p class='c000'>They soon crossed a clear running brook, and
leaving the bridge, Dick ran down to the water's
edge to get a drink.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Drink through your handkerchief!" called
out Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Through my handkerchief?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What for?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because you don't want to swallow a lizard
or worse. These waters are full of small animal
life, so I've been told."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick did as the Englishman suggested. And
he was glad of it, for while bending down he
saw several tiny lizards or leeches swimming
near at hand. "None in me, not if I know it,"
he murmured as he drew back. "I'll inspect
everything that goes down my throat after this."</p>

<p class='c000'>By noon they had covered several miles. The
sun was out clear, and now the heat began to
tell on them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I move we rest," suggested Leander; and
this was readily agreed to, and they sat down
under an immense plantain, covered with half
ripe fruit—that fruit which we commonly know
by the name of banana, although the real banana
is red.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are there any wild animals in Porto Rico?"
questioned Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm sure I don't know," answered Robert
Menden. "I shouldn't look for anything very
large on an island of this size. All the large
stock has probably been killed off by the
natives."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I reckon you'll find wild-cats here an' wild
hogs," put in old Jacob. "An, let me tell ye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>thet a real wild hog is about as dangerous as a
wolf or a leetle bear. But it ain't likely thet
any wild animals would keep themselves around
such a road as this. They would take to the
mountains and stay there, so long as they could
git enough to eat."</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest was not half over when Dick grew
restless, and arose to take a look at his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm bound to see all I can of the country,"
he said, with a smile. "Will you come, Leander?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly," was the answer; and in a moment
more the two chums were strolling off.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Be back inside of fifteen minutes," shouted
Robert Menden, and both called back that they
understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seemed to be a fine grove of orange
trees to the left of the road, and toward this
they made their way, wondering if they could
pick up any fruit fit to eat.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It must be fine to have such fruit ready to
hand," observed Leander, as they entered the
grove. "I reckon the natives don't know the
value of what they've got."</p>

<p class='c000'>"They might say the same of our apples,
Leander. I'd rather have apples than oranges—that
is, I mean for regular."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, so would I. Don't they grow apples?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>"I don't think so—anyway, not such apples as
we have up North. It's too hot."</p>

<p class='c000'>They soon found that the oranges were even
more green than the plantains, or bananas, had
been. They passed the grove and came out on
a rocky stretch, overlooking a little valley
where flowed a tiny stream, glistening like silver
in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Beautiful scenery," murmured Leander, and
Dick agreed with him. Then a flock of gayly-colored
birds flew out of some brush to the right
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I only had my gun," cried Dick—for their
firearms had been left at the resting place.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us see if we can't locate their nests,"
said Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't want to rob their nests," declared
Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Neither do I; but we might have a look at
the kind of eggs they lay."</p>

<p class='c000'>So the pair set off through the brush and over
the rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had gone less than fifty yards when they
came to a spot covered with long rushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The ground seems to be shaky here," began
Leander, when suddenly, without warning, the
rushes gave way, and down plunged both boys
out of the bright sunlight into almost total
darkness.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> PRISONERS OF NATURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Dick!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Leander!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, my side!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, my leg!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are you seriously hurt?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I—I don't know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've had all the wind knocked out of me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ditto with me. What a tumble to take!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What kind of a place is this?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A hole—a big, deep, dark hole. One of the
caves, perhaps."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you think it's a—a bear's den, or something
like that?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, I don't. I reckon it's just a common,
everyday hole, or cave. The question is, how
are we going to get out?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To get out?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's what I said."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Climb out, of course."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's easy enough to say, but just look up
and see how far we are from the top."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>They looked up. The hole was all of thirty-five
or forty feet deep, and from ten to fifteen
feet across. The sides were of dirt and rocks,
covered here and there with wet moss.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luckily they had landed on a pile of half-decayed
leaves and tree branches, otherwise they
must have been seriously injured. The rushes
and some dirt had fallen all around them.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a full minute neither spoke. During
that time they examined the walls of the hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We've got to get out somehow," said Dick,
at last. "But to climb that wall seems impossible."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us try it, anyway," returned Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found what he considered the best place,
where several jagged rocks projected, and by
digging his hands into the soil succeeded in
pulling himself up a distance of eight or ten
feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Look out!"</p>

<p class='c000'>As Dick uttered the cry he leaped back out
of danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down came several of the rocks, accompanied
by a great mass of dirt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leander followed, to roll over on his back
on top of the pile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Great Cæsar!" gasped the fallen one. "I
didn't think I was going to pull down the whole
wall over me."</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/p096.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>"Don't try that again, or we may be buried
alive," cautioned Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't think I will try it," was the rueful
answer. "But, Dick, we <em>must</em> get out."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's true."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us yell for help."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't believe anybody is within hearing
distance."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never mind, we can try it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Both raised their voices, not once, but half a
dozen times. Then they listened intently.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did you hear anything?" asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not a sound."</p>

<p class='c000'>Their faces fell. What were they to do
next?</p>

<p class='c000'>"If we only had a rope," sighed Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Or a long pole."</p>

<p class='c000'>They walked around the flooring of the hole
dismally. Then Dick drew out his watch and
his face brightened.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The fifteen minutes are up. They'll be hunting
for us presently."</p>

<p class='c000'>He was right; the others of the expedition
were both hunting and calling, but nothing was
seen or heard of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Led by old Jacob the party went through the
orange grove, but came up a goodly distance to
the left of the hole in which the poor boys were
prisoners of nature.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Another quarter of an hour went by. To Dick
and Leander it seemed an age. Again they
cried out, but the top of the hole being smaller
than the bottom, their voices were as muffled as
though they were prisoners in a huge bottle.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is truly a pickle," groaned Dick, as he
threw himself on one of the fallen rocks. "I
must say, I'm stumped."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So am I."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm going to try throwing stones out of the
hole," said Dick, after another interval of
silence. "Anything is better than doing nothing."</p>

<p class='c000'>Both boys began to shy out all of the stones
they could pick up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We're really making the hole deeper," observed
Leander, when suddenly the opening
above them was darkened, and they saw a negro
boy looking down at them with eyes as big as
saucers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hullo, help us out!" cried Leander, eagerly;
but at the sound of their voices the negro boy
took to his heels as fast as he could go.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He's gone!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps he has gone for a rope."</p>

<p class='c000'>"More than likely he was scared to death.
He'll go home and say he saw a ghost."</p>

<p class='c000'>Another quarter of an hour went by. Then
they heard footsteps approaching, and two stalwart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Caribs appeared. Behind them came the
little boy, trembling with fear.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hullo!" repeated Leander. "Help us out,
will you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Un Americano!</span></i>" muttered one of the Caribs.
"How you git down dar?" he asked, in broken
English.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We fell through the rushes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Um—bad place dis to walk."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So we have discovered. Will you kindly
help us out?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Both of the negroes nodded. Then they withdrew,
to consult one with another. Presently
they came back.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How much give if pull you out de hole?" demanded
the one who had previously spoken.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Give?" came from both boys simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ye—as, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</span></i> rich boys, not so?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, we are not rich," replied Dick in disgust.
"But we'll pay you, don't fear."</p>

<p class='c000'>"How much give?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll give you a dollar," added Leander.
"Gosh, but they believe in making money, don't
they," he added, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No take dollar," came from the Porto Rican.
"Take ten dollar."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ten dollars!" gasped Dick, not so much over
the amount of the sum, but because of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>"cheek" in asking it. "You don't want much,
do you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll give two dollars—we can't pay any
more," said Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at this the Caribs shook their woolly
heads. They were bound to make money out
of the Americans' misfortune. Such a thing
as being generous never entered their heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ten dollar, or we go away again," said the
one who could speak broken English.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll give you three dollars," said Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, ten dollar."</p>

<p class='c000'>To this the Caribs stuck, and at last the boys
promised them the amount.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But you have got to pull us out first," said
Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even to this the negroes demurred, and in the
end it was agreed to pay five dollars first, and
the second five when they were safe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick took some Spanish money and tied it
in, a handkerchief, which he threw up so that
the largest of the Caribs could catch it. Then
one of the natives ran off to get a long rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Getting up out of the hole by the aid of the
rope was comparatively easy. As soon as the
youths were on the top of the earth once more,
each of the natives caught a boy and held him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now pay udder five dollars to Bumbum,"
grinned the leader of the pair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>"Is your name Bumbum?" demanded Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All right, Bumbum, here is the money, and
let me say that I think you about the meanest
Porto Rican on the island."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bumbum must earn his living, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't call this earning a living. What do
you do, as a general rule? Lie about to squeeze
strangers?"</p>

<p class='c000'>At this the Carib's face darkened. "No insult
me, or you be sorry!" he cried, and made a
movement as if to draw some weapon from his
bosom.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Come, let us be going," cried Leander, in
alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm ready," was Dick's reply, and they hurried
off in one direction, while Bumbum and his
companion, accompanied by the negro boy,
stalked off in another. Soon the two parties
were lost to sight of each other; but that was
not the last, by any means, that was seen of the
wily Caribs.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>"Well, well, boys, where have ye been?
We've been a-huntin' high an' low fer ye!"</p>

<p class='c000'>And so speaking, old Jacob rushed up to them,
followed by all the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick told their story, to which the remainder
of the party listened with close attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's lucky the Caribs came up," was Robert
Menden's comment. "But they made you pay
dearly for their services."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was downright robbery!" burst out the
old Yankee tar. "If I run across 'em, I'll make
'em give up nine dollars o' the money, sure;
mark my words on't!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, I'm mighty glad we are out of it," said
Leander. "I wouldn't want to spend a night
down in that hole for twice ten dollars."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor I," added Dick. "Next time I'll be sure
where I am stepping."</p>

<p class='c000'>They continued on their way until five
o'clock, when it began to rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No use of getting wet," declared Robert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Menden. "I move we seek shelter for the
night."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was agreed to, and they hurried on to
where there stood a sort of wayside inn—a
rambling, two-story affair, built of rough stone
and whitewashed.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tall and not overly-pleasant looking Spaniard
received them, and soon Dick had arranged
for supper, lodging and breakfast for the entire
party.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wayside inn was almost deserted, only
the proprietor, his wife and a negro servant
being present.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were shown to two rooms in the second
story—low apartments, but well ventilated—and
here their host left them, stating that supper
would be ready at seven o'clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys surveyed the apartments with interest.
Each room was perfectly square, with its
floor covered with a rough matting of sea-grass.
The walls were bare, saving for one or two religious
pictures miserably executed. The beds
were old-fashioned "four-posters," covered with
straw ticks and plain white sheets, nothing
more.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They don't need blankets," observed old
Jacob. "A man can keep warm without half
tryin'. Thet's why the windows ain't got no
glass in 'em, an' there ain't no stoves around."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The rain continued to come down steadily, so
that they could not roam about the place. After
a general washing up, they went below, to find
their host, Jose Maguel, snoring lustily in an
easy-chair in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Half-past six," said Menden, looking at his
watch. "I wonder what they will give us for
supper?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He promised us chicken," answered Dick.
"But it ought to be cooking by this time."</p>

<p class='c000'>He walked through the dining-room and into
the apartment that did duty as a kitchen. Beyond,
in the yard, the servant was stirring up a
small charcoal fire, built under a shelter of
palm thatch, the sides being open so that the
smoke and heat might escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently a negro boy hove into view on the
road. He carried in his hand the body of a
dead rooster. As he came closer, Dick saw that
the fowl had steel spurs attached to his legs.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A dead gamecock," he muttered. "I'll
wager there has been cock-fighting somewhere,
and Señor Maguel is going to dish us up the defeated
fowl."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick hurried back to the others and told them
of what he had seen. At once old Jacob grew
indignant and rushed to the rear of the inn,
where the servant was in the act of decapitating
the dead fowl with an axe.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>"We won't eat thet, consarn ye!" he cried,
pointing his long, bony finger at the fowl.
"We want chicken—good barnyard fowls—an'
don't ye forgit it!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl did not understand a word of what
was said, but she understood his actions and
stepped back, dropping the gamecock as she did
so. At once old Jacob secured the fowl, and
marched into the inn with it, and up to where
Jose Maguel still sat snoring in the chair. A
shake of the shoulder aroused the innkeeper,
and he gazed in bewilderment when the old Yankee
tar held up the gamecock before his nose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do ye suppose civilized Americans air
a-goin' to eat thet?" came from old Jacob,
wrathfully. "I'd jest as lief eat crow. We
want real chicken, killed fer the purpose o' eating,
understand?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Un Americano</span></i> no like dis?" queried Jose
Maguel, mildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, we don't like it, not by a jugful. You
give us real chicken."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dis chicken—good chicken."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a slaughtered fowl from one o' yer cockfights,"
roared old Jacob. "Like ez not, he's
pizened from the other bird's cuts. Oh, I know
all on ye do nothing but look at cock-fighting
day in an' day out, much to yer discredit. We
want good chicken, understand?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>"Yes. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señor</span> shall have good chicken,"
growled the Spaniard; and inwardly very angry,
but not daring to show it before so many strangers,
he took the gamecock and passed into the
kitchen with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He'll make you eat it if he can," observed
Leander. "He's mad clear through, I can see
that."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm going to watch him, lad, until the meal
is on the table," replied old Jacob; and this he
did, and made certain that they got a chicken
which was caught and killed for that purpose.
Cock-fighting is a national sport in Porto Rico,
and it is a great trick to work off the slain fowls
on anybody who does not know the difference,
the natives rarely eating their fallen champions.</p>

<p class='c000'>When supper was served it was by no means
a bad meal, although all of the party had eaten
better. It consisted of chicken, rice cakes, fried
sweet potatoes, baked bananas, and bread and
jelly, with strong native coffee. As they ate, the
host sat by, but said nothing to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We may as well retire early," observed
Robert Menden. "We want to reach the vicinity
of the caves by to-morrow."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did you ask the landlord about the caves?"
queried Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I mentioned them in an off-hand way, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>he said he knew nothing about them." And
this, let me add, is not strange, for it is but
lately that the caves have become known to the
great majority of people.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We don't want to let anybody suspect our
mission here," put in Bob. "They might follow
and rob us, you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Thet's it," added old Jacob. "As long as we
know about where the caves are, ye had better
keep yer trap closed. I allers found thet it
paid not to talk too much in a strange country."</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden had his written description
of the caves with him, and before retiring, all
hands pored over this, hoping by it to gain some
clew concerning the box with the initials, M.
M. M.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rain continued to come down, but it did
not lightning and thunder, and the gentle patter-patter
on the roof acted as a lullaby to the
tired boys, everyone of whom went sound asleep
in short order. Then Robert Menden and old
Jacob dropped off, and all became quiet in the
two rooms which the party occupied.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long he slept Don did not know. But
he awoke with a start and sat up, not knowing
what had aroused him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The room was in semi-darkness, the smoky
lamp being turned down low. All of the others
were sleeping soundly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>"Dick!" he cried softly, but there was no reply
from his chum.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bob! Leander!" he continued after a long
pause. Still no answer, saving a long snore
from Bob, as he turned over restlessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's mighty queer what woke me up," thought
the boy. He usually slept well.</p>

<p class='c000'>He dropped back on the bed and tried to go
to sleep again.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the effort was a failure, and though he
lay back with his eyes tightly closed, he was as
wide-awake as before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, of a sudden, although he heard nothing,
a peculiar sensation stole over him, and he
became convinced that some stranger was in the
apartment!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> THE MAN IN THE ROOM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Don shivered, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He felt positive that he was right—that somebody
was moving around the room—yet so far
he had not heard a sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can it be the landlord?" he asked himself.
"If it is, what is he doing here?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The bed in which the boy rested was turned
in such a fashion that he could see but a small
portion of the apartment in his present position.</p>

<p class='c000'>As noiselessly as he could, he shifted about
until the entire room was within his range of
vision.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was just in time to behold a shadow
cross the doorsill and glide into the next apartment,
where Robert Menden, old Jacob and
Danny were sleeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a slight puff of air came in at one
of the windows, extinguishing the smoky lamp
and leaving all in total darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wake up, all of you!" cried Don, at the top
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>of his lungs. "Somebody is here who doesn't
belong here!"</p>

<p class='c000'>At his cry one after another leaped up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's thet?" demanded old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Somebody just entered your room."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There he goes—out of the window!" ejaculated
Robert Menden, and ran toward the spot,
only to stumble over a chair and stub his toe so
severely that he set up a howl of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Jacob turned quickly enough to see the
man's head as he swung from the window-sill
to the ground below, a distance of less than
twelve feet. In the darkness he saw the fellow,
a native, rush away at top speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stop, ye villain!" he roared. "Stop, or I'll
fire!" Then he ran to his bed to get his revolver,
which had been placed under his pillow,
but by the time he reached the window again
the midnight marauder had disappeared into
a wood opposite the inn.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He must have entered the rooms for the purpose
of robbing us," said Dick. "Let us light
the lamp and see if anything is missing."</p>

<p class='c000'>A match was struck and the lamp turned up
as high as possible, and then they began an examination
of their clothing and bundles. Only
one set of trouser-pockets had been cleaned out—those
belonging to Bob, who had lost a good
knife, a bunch of keys and a couple of dollars in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Spanish small change. Nothing else had been
disturbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don scared him off," said Dick. "Otherwise
he would have gone through every pocket
and package in the two rooms," and the others
agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'd like to catch the rascal," grumbled Bob.
"That knife was a prize one and I don't want to
lose it—nor the money neither."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We would have a job tracking that thief in
this storm," answered Robert Menden. "Let
us be thankful the matter is no worse, and be
more on our guard in the future."</p>

<p class='c000'>The noise in the rooms had awakened the
landlord of the inn and he now knocked on the
door, demanding what was the matter. He
drew down the corners of his mouth when told.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Porto Rico brigands, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señors</span>," he said.
"Be glad they no knife you!" and he shivered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps," said old Jacob, laconically. "But
maybe you are in with them," he muttered to
himself, as he turned away. The gamecock
episode still hung in his mind, and certainly the
landlord's general appearance was much
against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the balance of the night one or another
of the party was awake, and it was decided that
in the future they should take turns on the
watch, just as had been done on the yacht.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>In the morning they had breakfast very early,
having contracted for this beforehand. Had
they not done so, nobody at the inn would have
stirred before eight o'clock, and breakfast
would not have been on the table until nine or
ten. To many living in Porto Rico time seems
to be of little value. Almost all of the business
is done between ten and twelve o'clock in the
morning, and after that the shopkeeper locks
up his place and takes a nap until four or five
o'clock, opening up again in the evening, which
is really the busiest part of the whole twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm had cleared off and now the atmosphere
was sultry and oppressive, the evaporations
from the forests going up like clouds of
steam.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Phew! this is going to be a corker!" exclaimed
Dick, as he mopped the perspiration
from his brow. They had covered less than two
miles, and yet he felt completely dragged out.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll take a rest when we come to a suitable
spot," announced Robert Menden. "But
we must push on all we can before twelve
o'clock. Nobody will want to move a step between
that time and four, mark my words."</p>

<p class='c000'>Menden had scarcely spoken when a large
flock of birds arose directly in front of them.
The young hunters could not resist the temptation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to take a shot at the creatures, and one
after another fired their weapons, bringing
down seven of the birds.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Good enough!" cried Robert Menden. "I
see that all of you can shoot, and I am glad
of it, for there is no telling what will turn up
before this treasure-hunt is over."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Before I leave Porto Rico I want a little
chance to hunt and fish," said Dick. "It
wouldn't be a real summer outing without that."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm out fer dat money dis trip," put in
Danny. "Say, I hopes yer git about a million
dollars, so I do!" and he shook his head enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't speak of it quite so loudly, Danny,"
cautioned the Englishman. "This is a secret
search, you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, dat's so—I forgot," answered the Irish
lad. "I'll be as mum as an oyster after dis."</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming to a bit of high ground overlooking
one of the numerous valleys of upper Porto
Rico, they sat down on several flat rocks to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden calculated that they were
within a few miles of Caguas, and announced
that the next night might be spent there.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And then we must pick up some reliable
native guide to take us to the great caves," he
added.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scenery from where they sat was truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>grand. Hills and valleys were clothed in every
variety of tropical growth, from the tallest of
royal palms to the heavy grass—grass the like
of which none of the boys had ever seen. Far
in the distance were the great mountains, ranging
along for miles, their sharp ridges clearly
defined against the blue sky. Smaller ridges
came down toward them, the lower ones more
smooth on their tops, and covered with great
patches of grass, where fed cattle and sheep
innumerable.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's certainly a charming island, so far as
looks go," murmured Leander. "But I believe
this atmosphere would make the most active
man in the world lazy sooner or later."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a good climate for invalids," said Robert
Menden. "Some day Porto Rico is bound to
become a great winter resort for Americans
and others."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I want to get to the top of yonder mountains
before I leave," put in Leander. "If we—Great
Scott! Look out!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He leaped up in terror; and small wonder, for
from under the flat rock a serpent, all of seven
feet long, had glided. Now it raised its head
and showed its cruel fangs, as if to strike at one
or another of the startled party.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> A LIVELY FIGHT WITH A SERPENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"A snake!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Kill it, somebody!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Run, before it strikes you!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Such were some of the cries which rang out,
as all started to secure places of comparative
safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a pistol shot rang out. The report
came from old Jacob's weapon, but the bullet
passed over the serpent's head.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time all had crowded to the edge of
the little opening.</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind them was a series of jagged rocks, the
climbing of which would be no easy task. In
front was a cliff overlooking the valley, and on
one side were heavy bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only escape, therefore, lay to their left.
But here was where the snake had located itself,
as if to make them prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We're in a pickle," groaned Dick, as he drew
his own pistol. Bang! went the weapon, and
the bullet clipped the reptile's tail.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wound enraged the serpent, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>slashed right and left with pain. Then it
raised its head once more and darted straight
for Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its eyes blazed like twin diamonds, and it
may truthfully be said that for a moment the
owner of the Dashaway was dazed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now a most unexpected thing happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dash had wandered off in the brush and been
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>He leaped into view with a bound and coming
up behind the snake caught it in the neck with
his strong teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a grating sound, and the head of
the snake twisted painfully and then dropped
limply.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Good for Dash!" cried Don, and rushing up,
he fired his pistol at the snake's body, literally
cutting it in half.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Dash dropped the quivering body, and
to settle matters, Robert Menden crushed the
head with a sharp stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was several minutes before anybody recovered
his former composure.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dash am de greatest dog wot ever lived!"
cried Danny, and hugged the canine around the
neck. At this Dash wagged his tail furiously,
as though he understood perfectly. But
strange to say, now the snake was dead, the dog
could not be coaxed to go anywhere near it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>"He knew we were in danger," declared Bob.
"Otherwise you couldn't have hired him to
tackle a thing like that," and the others were
forced to admit that this must be so.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one wanted to remain in that locality, so
they set off once more without further delay.
The road was now steeper than before, and by
the time Caguas came into sight, everybody was
fagged out and glad to think that traveling for
that day had come to an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appearance of the town was a disappointment
to them. Caguas contains but five
thousand inhabitants, mostly Caribbean negroes,
and there are only a few buildings of fair
size. The other shelters are mere huts, stretching
along irregular streets, which are dirty in
themselves and piled high with the refuse of
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The people here must be dirt poor," observed
Don. "Gracious! I never thought to see such
poverty—and with so much good land around
that might be cultivated."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Many of the folks won't work, no matter
how hard ye drive 'em," answered old Jacob.
"They live by stealin' their neighbors' fruit, and
when they want anything from San Juan or
Ponce they go into the woods, pick a bag or two
o' cocoanuts, and take 'em along on a pony to
trade with."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>"Which goes to prove that it's not a good
thing for nature to provide a man with too easy
a living," laughed Dick. "Real labor would be
the making of lots of these natives."</p>

<p class='c000'>To find proper accommodations in Caguas
was not an easy matter. There was a small
hotel, but this had been visited by fire and no
rooms were to be had there.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will take you in," said a native, who met
them. "My house is the cleanest in the village,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señors</span>. Come;" and they followed him almost
to the outskirts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The native's name was Carlos Remora, and
all found him "a pretty decent sort of a fellow,"
to use Robert Menden's manner of expressing
it. He was a heavy-set mulatto and
spoke very fair English.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I travel to Florida once," he said, with much
pride. "I show a man how to raise oranges.
Stay dare two years, den come back here."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why didn't you remain in Florida?" queried
Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wife no like it dare—she have all her family
here. But now wife dead and Carlos Remora
alone in de worl'."</p>

<p class='c000'>As they had agreed to pay him well, the native
provided an excellent supper, baking among
other things some delicious cakes made of
banana flour, with grated cocoanut on top.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>There were but two rooms to his house, which
was only a single story in height. He occupied
one, with Danny and old Jacob, while the others
of the party occupied the second.</p>

<p class='c000'>But sleep was next to impossible. The house
was certainly clean, so far as dirt was concerned,
but it was alive with bugs, ants and
other insects, for this portion of Porto Rico is
overrun with these pests.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh my!" roared Don, after he had been in
bed less than an hour. "I'm being eaten up
alive!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ditto," came from Bob. He turned up the
light. "What's this on the floor, spots of dirt?
No, by gracious, they're moving! And look at
the beds!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We've struck a bug colony!" put in Dick.
"I reckon we're in for it for the balance of this
night."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm going outside and sleep on the ground,"
announced Leander. "If I stay here I'll get the
nightmare, sure. Ugh!" And slipping on his
trousers, he made a dash for the open air, and
the others followed. Soon the owner of the
house was aroused, but he could do nothing for
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My house best house in Caguas," he said,
simply. "Nobody can stop de bugs an' ants.
Must let dem run," and he went back to bed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The boys and Robert Menden shook out their
blankets and tried to get some sleep outside,
under the trees, but were not very successful,
and were glad enough when the rising sun announced
another day at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And now for the treasure cave!" whispered
Dick to Robert Menden, and the Englishman
smiled and squeezed his hand in silence. The
two had taken a great liking to each other from
the very start.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden had been talking confidentially
with the native, and had come to the conclusion
that the man could be thoroughly
trusted. He now asked Remora if he knew
anything of the caves.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have seen a part of the Dark Cave, which
is on a plantation six miles from here," he said.
"It is a bad place—nobody go dare for fun."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what of the other caves?" asked the
Englishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Udder caves little way off, all bad—no Porto
Ricans go dare. Once two men go; one break
leg, udder get eye knocked out by somebody in
de cave."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Got his eye knocked out!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>. He in dark, when baf! something
strike, an' he lose his eye. Werry bad
place—better you not go down."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly we don't want to lose our eyes,"
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>was the Englishman's comment. "But will you
take us to the entrance to the different caves?
We will pay you for your trouble."</p>

<p class='c000'>At first Carlos Remora demurred, but finally,
when offered a dollar a day for his services by
Dick, he consented to go along, and also agreed
to take along enough provisions to last the
whole party several days.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Many tourists come on horseback," he said.
"But the way is safer on foot. Horse may
throw you in a hole."</p>

<p class='c000'>Being assured that the climb up into the
mountains would be a difficult one, they took
their time in making their preparations for the
departure. Bob had torn his coat and this was
sewn up before leaving.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leander was the only one to grow impatient,
and stalked around urging the others to hurry.
Then he started up the road alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not yet passed out of sight when they
heard him utter a shout.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's up?" called out Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Come here—somebody is in trouble!" returned
Leander, and then the whole party set
off to see what was the matter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> THE EXPOSURE OF THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Leander had seen a man lying on the road on
his back. Evidently the fellow was unconscious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over the form bent another man, and it was
none other than Bumbum, the Carib who had
taxed Leander and Dick ten dollars for pulling
them from the hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Leander uttered his shout, Bumbum raised
his head, and then shook his fist at the youth.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Leander was undaunted, and ran forward
to detain the Carib until the others might
arrive on the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Bumbum was not to be caught thus easily,
and when Leander grabbed him by the arm, he
struck fiercely at the boy and then tore himself
loose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is he?" came from Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There he goes—the fellow who took the ten
dollars from Dick and me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And who is this man?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't know, but I think the Carib knocked
him down."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>At once a rush was made to the spot where
Bumbum had disappeared, and the wood and
brush was searched thoroughly for a distance
of ten or fifteen rods.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime Robert Menden had come
up, and was gazing in open-mouthed wonder at
the man lying in the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Joseph Farvel!" he gasped. "What a meeting!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is this Joseph Farvel, your enemy?" ejaculated
Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The very same, lad. I wonder if he is
dead?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't think so. But he got a bad crack
on the head, that's certain."</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Farvel lay in a slight hollow on the
road. He had been hit over the left eye by
some blunt instrument, probably a club, and
the blood was pouring copiously from the
wound.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forgetting that this sour-faced man was his
worst enemy, Robert Menden whipped out his
handkerchief, soaked it in a nearby pool of
water, and bound it about Farvel's head.
Then he and old Jacob carried the sufferer to
a shady spot under a tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime the others gathered around,
and then Don uttered a cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bob's knife!"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>He was right; there lay the knife beside the
spot where Joseph Farvel had rested.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's mine, sure enough," said Bob, as he
looked the blade over. He gazed at Robert
Menden. "Do you think it was this Joseph
Farvel who entered our room?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Great Cæsar! Perhaps."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I believe it was that Bumbum," put in Dick.
"I remember now that he cast longing glances
at my pocketbook when I paid him that second
five dollars. He is a regular brigand—or rather,
a common sneak thief and footpad—and he probably
tackled this Farvel for what he could get
out of the fellow."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I reckon as how Dick is right," was old
Jacob's comment. He turned to the Englishman.
"What do ye think is best to do concerning
your enemy?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden thought for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't want to leave him to die here," he said
slowly. "That wouldn't be human. Cannot
some of your party watch over him until he
comes around, while I get out of sight?"</p>

<p class='c000'>This was decided upon, and after some more
conversation on the point, Robert Menden hurried
on, accompanied by Dick, Don and Bob,
leaving Leander, Danny, old Jacob and the
Porto Rican behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was fully half an hour ere Joseph Farvel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>showed any signs of returning to consciousness.
In the meantime those around the man made
him as comfortable as circumstances permitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last he opened his eyes and sat up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where—what's the matter?" he asked, in a
cold, disagreeable voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You were struck down on the road," answered
Leander. "Don't you remember?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I—yes, I remember being hit from over the
shoulder. Who did it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A native—we caught sight of him running
away," put in old Jacob. "I don't believe you
are seriously hurt, though."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't know." Joseph Farvel gave a deep
groan. "What beastly luck I'm having, to be
sure! Did the native rob me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You'll have to find that out for yourself,"
answered Leander. "We don't know what is
in your pockets."</p>

<p class='c000'>With some difficulty Joseph Farvel went
through first one pocket and then another, and
then he gave another groan.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My purse is gone—and it contained over
eight pounds!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You certainly had hard luck," was old
Jacob's comment. "Where are you bound?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To the next village. I was—ah—roaming
about these mountains, but I'm rather sick of
it."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>"The mountains seem to be very nice," observed
Leander, dryly. "We are taking a look
around, too."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Indeed! Found anything of special interest?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a beastly island, and I shan't stay here
long." Joseph Farvel staggered to his feet.
"My head swims like a top!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would remain resting for awhile," said
Leander. "You are not strong enough yet."</p>

<p class='c000'>"My boy, you don't know me. I'm stronger
than you think for." The sufferer turned to
Carlos Remora. "How far to Caguas?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Less than two miles, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can easily make that before noon, and I
might as well travel before it gets too hot."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You may be attacked again," said Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll be on my guard, and if I am, I'll shoot
the rascal. I am much obliged for what you
did for me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's all right."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Always ready to help a gentleman in distress,"
observed Danny, with a wink behind
Farvel's back at Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's all right. So you are bound for the
mountains. Beware of the holes, or caves, as
some of the natives call them."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have this man with us as a guide," said
Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>"Indeed! Well, take care, that's all I have
to say, and good-bye to you," and so speaking,
Joseph Farvel staggered off, but at a rapid
gait.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He certainly has grit," whispered Leander.
"He's a bad man to have for an enemy. What
wicked eyes!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Jest so," said old Jacob. "He wouldn't
hesitate to heave a man overboard, an' I know
it. Menden must keep his weather eye open."</p>

<p class='c000'>The party resumed their march up the mountain
side, and at the first turn joined the others
behind a large, projecting rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Englishman listened with interest to all
that they had to tell.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'd give a good bit to know if he has discovered
anything," he observed. "Being in
such a hurry to get to Caguas makes me a little
suspicious. Perhaps he has located the treasure,
and now wants to make arrangements for
getting it away."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He can't have been here so very long," put
in Don. "We came through as fast as we were
able."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I told you he would want to put his hands
on that gold as soon as he could. But come,
there is no use in wasting time here."</p>

<p class='c000'>Up and up they went, along a twisting and
turning trail, now broad, and then again so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>narrow, that Dick wondered how a horse might
find his way without slipping. Yet the native
assured him that horses sometimes came that
way with heavy burdens on their backs.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Da get use to it, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>," he added. "But
him bad—sometimes fall an' go dead." And
Dick believed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first range passed, they began to descend
into a valley. Here the oranges, bananas and
other tropical fruit grew in profusion, and in
the brush could be seen numerous wild coffee
berries just turning a beautiful red. The boys
tasted them, to find them very bitter; "not a
bit like cooked coffee," as Don put it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's the ripeness and roasting that brings
out the flavor," said Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently they came to a mountain torrent,
all of twenty feet wide and ten to twelve feet
deep. There was no bridge, but a large palm
tree lay from bank to bank, and over this they
made their way, one following the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What about horses here?" questioned Leander.
"You don't mean to say they walk this
sort of a tight-rope."</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, horses go up de water and walk on
rocks," answered Carlos Remora.</p>

<p class='c000'>Danny was the last to set foot on the tree,
the others being some distance ahead. He was
over the very center of the stream when a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>bird, flying from some nearby bushes directly
past his face, startled him. He uttered a yell,
and turning around, the others were just in
time to see him slip from the tree and disappear
with a splash into the swirling stream below.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> IN WHICH DANNY IS RESCUED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Danny has fallen into the river!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Danny! Danny! can you save yourself?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The little fellow will be drowned!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He shan't be drowned, not if I can help it,"
burst out Bob. He had not forgotten how
Danny had saved him from harm, while they
were skating on the lake at home the winter
before.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang toward Carlos Remora, who carried
over his shoulder one of the long ropes
which Robert Menden had requested should be
taken along, for possible use in the caves to be
visited.</p>

<p class='c000'>At one end was a loose noose, and holding
this in readiness, he ran some distance below
the spot where the Irish lad had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The others followed him, but Dick thoughtfully
took to the other side of the watercourse,
thinking that perhaps he might be able to render
additional assistance from that point.</p>

<p class='c000'>All realized Danny's peril. His friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>knew that he could swim, but swimming would
be of small help in that rushing, roaring torrent,
with its sharp rocks and snags of fallen trees.
Should his head strike on one of the rocks they
felt that all would be over.</p>

<p class='c000'>The banks of the stream were several feet
high, of broken stones and black dirt, and to
get down to the water's edge was not easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet Bob was undaunted and leaped straight
down, at the risk of a broken or twisted ankle.
Danny must be rescued at any cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Danny! Where are you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>One and another uttered the cry, but no answer
came back. The truth was, that the Irish
lad had been carried so far under that his head
had struck, and now he was more than half unconscious
and unable to do more than gasp for
breath, and that meant to merely take in water.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There he is!"</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Don who uttered the cry. He pointed
to the center of the stream, where a fallen tree
projected several feet over the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irish boy was struggling between the
half decayed branches, but was too weak to
clear himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He's going to drown as sure as fate!" muttered
old Jacob. "Perhaps I had better go in
fer him!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, no; I'll go in!" cried Bob, and slipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the rope around his waist. In a second more
he had entered the water, which at this point
boiled in a milky-white foam.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the shore it was not over three feet deep,
yet he found that it was all he could do to keep
his feet. The bottom was of rock, worn smooth
by constant rubbing. Out and out he went,
foot by foot, until half the distance to the fallen
tree was covered.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was now up to his armpits, and could no
longer keep his footing. With a dash he set
out to swim the remainder of the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never had brave Bob undertaken a more difficult
task. As though he were a feather, the
force of the current carried him downward
until he was almost past the extreme end of the
half-sunken tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild splash and one hand caught the last
branch. At first it looked as if he would be
torn loose. But he held on like grim death,
and slowly, but surely, pulled himself closer to
where Danny rested.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Bob, save me; please do!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irish boy's words were scarcely intelligible.
He had raised himself up so that his head
was clear, but could do no more, and was in
immediate danger of sinking back again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll save you, Danny; keep your courage,"
was Bob's reply, and coming closer, the youth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>drew the Irish lad still further up, to a point
of temporary safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>Old Jacob and several of the others had
caught hold of the end of the rope, which Bob
had left with them. Now the rope was entangled
about the half-sunken tree, and the boy had his
hands full in trying to disengage it and support
Danny at the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Be careful, Bob, or you'll both go down!"
shouted Robert Menden. "That tree may not
be as secure as you imagine."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Englishman had scarcely spoken when
there came a dull crack, and the upper portion
of the tree turned over and disappeared from
view, to emerge again twenty feet below the
spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob and Danny were hurled headlong, and,
caught in the foaming and raging torrent, went
over and over.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Pull on that rope!" yelled Dick, and plunged
in to the rescue of his two friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three boys came together at a spot where
a small rock appeared several inches above the
foam. All had hold of the rope, but Bob and
Dick had to support the Irish lad between them,
for he was on the point of becoming totally unconscious.</p>

<p class='c000'>The others pulled upon the rope with might
and main, and slowly but surely the human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>freight came shoreward, at a point some distance
below where old Jacob and the others
stood.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last they were at a point where the water
was not over three feet deep, and Bob and Dick
staggered out to a grassy spot and deposited
Danny on his back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Irish lad's eyes were closed and he did
not move.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He's full of water, I reckon!" cried old
Jacob, and forthwith began to roll the boy, and
then held him up by the ankles. By this means
Danny got rid of considerable of the element
he had swallowed; but it was a good hour before
he came to his senses, and then he was so
weak, that travelling, so far as he was concerned,
was out of the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>A consultation was held, and it was decided
that Bob, Dick and Danny should remain near
the river until nightfall, when Carlos Remora
would bring the rest of the party back, unless,
of course, something of importance was discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys were left some provisions and their
firearms, and soon Don, Leander and the others
were out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the three who had been in the stream were
sopping wet, it was decided by them to take
off their clothing and let it dry by hanging on
some bushes in the hot sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>In the meantime Dick built a small fire and
made a pot of hot coffee, of which all partook
with great satisfaction, along with several
sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sure an' I t'ought I was a goner," said
Danny, when he felt strong enough to speak.
"My, but don't dat river run fast!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"In a place like this, one has to have all his
wits about him," answered Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll have me wits about me when I cross another
tree bridge, dat's as sure as yer born,"
concluded Danny.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the articles they carried, the boys had
several fishing lines, and while Danny rested,
Bob and Dick baited with some land crabs they
succeeded in catching, and threw into the
stream to try their luck.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've got a bite!" cried Bob, a half minute
later, and drew in his haul, a tiny brown fish
weighing not over three or four ounces.
"Not worth anything," he muttered, disappointedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short while later Dick felt a jerk, and at
once his line began to leave his hand rapidly.
"Something big," he cried, and played his catch
as skillfully as he could. Inside of five minutes
the fish was landed—a speckled beauty of
at least three pounds. It was no wonder that
Dick was quite proud of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>But fish were not plentiful in that stream,
and at the end of two hours they gave up the
sport, each having caught two of fair size and
several little things besides.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dat fish would taste mighty fine baked on a
red-hot stone," said Danny; and to please the
Irish lad, Bob proceeded to start up the fire,
and soon a fish was done to a turn. It was
the largest of the mess, but their appetites were
good and they ate all there was of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward sunset they began to look forward to
the return of the others, but nobody put in an
appearance, and once the great orb of day went
down, it grew dark rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hope they return," observed Dick; and
growing a trifle anxious, he walked from the
hollow and up the road the party under Remora
had taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was gone fully quarter of an hour and
came back in considerable excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I just caught sight of that Joseph Farvel,"
he announced. "He is on the other side of the
stream with two negroes, and the three are making
their way toward the tree bridge."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> STRANGERS IN CAMP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Joseph Farvel!" ejaculated Bob. "Did he
see you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't think so. The moment I spotted
him and his companions I dove out of sight behind
a rock. He and the others are carrying
quite some baggage, including torches and several
ropes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then he is bound for the caves, beyond a
doubt."</p>

<p class='c000'>"True; but he hadn't any rope with him before,
so I don't think he has discovered anything
yet. More than likely he found out that he
couldn't get to where he wanted to go without
a rope."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If dey is comin' over de bridge dey will see
dat smoke," put in Danny, as he pointed to the
fire—which was now burning low, but still
throwing off considerable smoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without delay Bob ran to the fire and kicked
it out. But the mischief had already been done,
and soon they heard Farvel and the two negroes
coming toward them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Their first impulse was to hide; their second,
to stay where they were. "We have done nothing
wrong—he can't harm us," said Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hullo, my Irish boy!" sung out Farvel, as
he caught sight of Danny. "What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sure an' we're restin'," replied Danny,
coolly. "How are ye afther feelin' now?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I'm first-rate again." Farvel looked at
Dick and Bob. "Did you belong to that party
I met this morning?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We did."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I didn't see you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We left before you came to your senses."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sorry we can't offer you any supper," said
Bob. "We just ate the last of what was
cooked."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've had my supper, thank you," was the
short reply. Then the man's face grew dark,
and he whipped a handkerchief from his pocket.
"Will you tell me who owns that?" he asked,
tossing the article over.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why dat's Mr. ——" began Danny, and
stopped short.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where did the handkerchief come from?"
questioned Dick slowly, hardly knowing what
to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was the one I found bound around my
head this morning, when I arrived at Caguas."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>"I didn't put it on your head."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you see the initials, R. D. M?" And
catching up the handkerchief once more, Joseph
Farvel pointed them out.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What of that? They are not my initials,"
said Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor mine."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dem must be old Rusher's initials," put in
Danny, quickly. Dat's his name, Rusher Daniel
March."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who is Rusher?" and Farvel's face took on
a different look.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You'll have to ask de captain, Mr. What's-your-name."</p>

<p class='c000'>"My name is Joseph Farvel."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, wot yer making all dis fuss about dat
handkerchief for?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know a man who has those initials—Robert
Dascott Menden, of London."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I suppose dare's lot uf fellers has dem same
letters, an' why not? I'll turn dat handkerchief
over to de rest of de crowd, if yer say so. I see
yer got yer head plastered up now."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What are you going to do with those ropes?"
asked Dick, determined to follow up the advantage
Danny's ready wit had brought them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is my business."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, all right. Sorry I spoke."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I want to know if you met this Robert Menden?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>"Perhaps I had better say that is my business,
too," answered Dick, coldly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I believe you have met him, and that that
is his handkerchief," went on Farvel, sourly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All right; think what you please. We did
you a good turn this morning, but you are not
making us particularly happy over it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, if you want pay for what you did, there
you are," growled the newcomer; and pulling a
couple of silver dollars from his pocket he flung
them at Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the instant Dick's face grew crimson, and
he walked up to the man with clenched fists.
"You are no gentleman, Joseph Farvel," he
cried. "I have seen quite enough of you. The
sooner you leave our camp, the better I will be
pleased."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And so will I be pleased," put in Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"An' yer kin take yer money wid yer," added
Danny. "We ain't so hard up as yer seem to
t'ink."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You don't dare to answer me about Robert
Menden," burst out Joseph Farvel.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have no reason to answer any of your
questions," said Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll wager all I am worth that he is with the
rest of your party."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what if that should be true," put in Bob.
"Hasn't a man a right to travel where he
pleases?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>"Robert Menden has no right to be on the
island of Porto Rico, and in this vicinity."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because he is after something that belongs
rightfully to me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He tells a different story," burst out Bob,
momentarily forgetting himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ha! so you acknowledge at last that he is
with you? Take my advice and beware of
him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would rather trust him than you," said
Dick, bluntly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So he has poisoned your minds against me,
eh? Very well, that is another score to settle
with him. As soon as I catch him I shall have
him arrested."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What for?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was he who knocked me down and robbed
me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nonsense; it was a Carib did, that!" cried
Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not believe it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If Robert Menden knocked you down, would
he take the trouble to bind up your wound afterward?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He probably got scared, being afraid that he
had killed me and must hang for it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You is away off de track," said Danny. "A
big black feller struck you down—we kin all
give our word on dat."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>"I am not willing to take your word."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you had better clear out and leave us
alone," said Dick, sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't get too dictatorial, young man."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I mean what I say. We did you a favor, and
you have made yourself as disagreeable as possible.
Now the sooner you take yourself off,
the better we shall be pleased."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bound to make me your enemy, eh?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think you have made yourself that already."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Be it so, but—" Joseph Farvel paused.
"Beware how any of you cross my path—that's
all."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, pshaw! I never did like melodramatics,"
cried Bob. "The world is wide enough for
us. You go your way, and let us go ours."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Answer me one question. Are you travelling
with Robert Menden?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are resting at present."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You know what I mean."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have nothing more to say," said Dick.
"Now leave us alone."</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Farvel's face grew blacker than ever.
"Be it so," he muttered. "But remember what
I said about crossing my path." And then he
turned away, taking his two negro companions
with him. In a few minutes a turn in the trail
took him out of the sight of the three boys.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>"I don't know whether we did right or
wrong," observed Dick, doubtfully. "I reckon
he knows now pretty nearly how matters stand."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wonder if he will meet Menden and the
others on the trail," said Bob. "I hope not."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If dey meet, dare will be a fight, an' I know
it," put in Danny. "Dat feller is a bad egg, if
ever dare was one."</p>

<p class='c000'>A half hour dragged by slowly. It was now
quite dark and the boys began to think that the
others would not be back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly a shot rang through the stillness of
the night air, followed by two others.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious! what does that mean?" demanded
Bob, leaping up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps it's the fight Danny mentioned," answered
Dick, grimly. He looked at his pistol.
"I've a good mind to walk down the trail and
investigate."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You may walk right into danger, Dick."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll risk it. You and Danny remain here
until I get back. There is no use in all of us
going."</p>

<p class='c000'>A few seconds later Dick was off on his mission.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> LOST IN THE FOREST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Dick felt that he must advance with caution,
having no desire to meet Joseph Farvel again,
if it could be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I may be able to help Menden and the others
more by keeping out of sight," he reasoned.
"If a fight is going on, I'll try to tackle the rascal
from the rear."</p>

<p class='c000'>No more shots reached his ears, and only the
cries of the night birds disturbed him as he advanced
slowly up the mountain path.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a dangerous trail in spots, and he
moved forward slowly. His pistol was in his
pocket, but right where he could lay his hand
upon it if necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick had gone a distance of two hundred
yards when he came to a spot where the trail
appeared to split into two parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here's trouble," he muttered. "Which path
shall I follow?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Getting down on his hands and knees he made
an examination of the dirt and the brush on
both sides. By the aid of a match he made out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>several footprints leading to the left. "I'll
take that," he concluded, as the match began to
burn his fingers and was dropped.</p>

<p class='c000'>On he went again, the trail now leading over
some rough rocks overlooking a second valley
covered with thick timber. On the opposite side
of the trail was a cliff, and the footpath was
not over two feet wide.</p>

<p class='c000'>How it happened, Dick could never tell afterward,
quite clearly. He slipped and stumbled,
and like a flash began to roll down the incline
leading to the valley. Over and over he went
like a barrel, and then came a drop, through
some brush into a hollow filled with dead leaves
and moss. In a few seconds he had travelled
several hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond a rude shaking up, he was not hurt in
the least; and as soon as he could catch his
breath he picked himself up and tried to climb
out of the hollow. All was pitch dark around
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is a pickle, truly," he groaned. "I
might better have remained with Bob and
Danny."</p>

<p class='c000'>But now was no time "to cry over spilt milk,"
as the popular saying is. He must get back to
the trail somehow.</p>

<p class='c000'>But getting back was not so easy. On leaving
the hollow he became turned around in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>darkness, and it was not long before he was
hopelessly mixed up. In his endeavor to pick
his way up the mountainside, he plunged deeper
and deeper into the forest, until all at once the
full realization of his situation burst upon him
like a flash.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was lost!</p>

<p class='c000'>Lost in that veritable jungle, which appeared
to stretch out for miles on every side of him.
The tall tropical trees were everywhere, festooned
with monstrous vines, while below grew
the dank moss and fungi, the home of countless
beetles, ants, spiders and other insects. No
wonder Dick shivered. It was a situation to
make any heart quail.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If it was only daylight," he thought. "But
it's as black as ink, and I haven't got so much
as a lantern."</p>

<p class='c000'>He felt in his pocket. He had still two
matches left and he drew them forth. Trying
one, he found it had no head.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Only one match that is good," he said, half
aloud. "I had better find the driest kind of
wood before I strike it."</p>

<p class='c000'>He searched around for several minutes, for
dry wood was scarce in a spot where all seemed
so damp for the want of sunshine. At last
he struck the match on a stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>It flashed up, sputtered—and went out. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>vain he tried to light it again—it would not give
forth a single spark.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the moment Dick felt like crying; he had
laid such a store by the looked-for light, which
would give him a fire and make him otherwise
comfortable. It looked as if he must spend the
remainder of the night in darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>But then a new thought came to him, and he
brought out his handkerchief and tore from it
several small strips, which he pulled apart and
rolled into a loose ball. Into this he thrust his
pistol and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The report brought a blaze of light with it,
and instantly the linen caught and blazed up
merrily. Over the ball the youth held several
small sticks, and then some larger ones, and
soon had a lively fire, which he took good care
should not die down for the want of fuel.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fire revealed nothing around him but
the endless trees and jungle of vines. As the
blaze flickered up it cast dancing shadows in
all directions, adding to the weirdness of the
scene. Dick had been alone before, but he had
never felt so lonely in his whole life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I ever get out of this, you won't catch me
going off alone again," he thought. "What's
to do next?"</p>

<p class='c000'>That was the absorbing question; but the only
answer he could give was to throw himself down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>by the fire and fall into an idle speculation. He
had not the least idea how to turn in order to
find the trail again.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last he grew sleepy and his eyes closed in
a light doze, from which he gave a start, as a
terrifying sound not far off reached his ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious, what's that?" he cried, and took
out his pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon the sound was repeated—a half grunt,
half squeal—and then a dark object loomed up
among the tree ahead of him. Two eyes shone
steadily out of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>With his nerves at their topmost tension,
Dick took hasty aim and fired twice. A furious
squeal rent the air and into the circle of light
staggered a badly wounded wild hog.</p>

<p class='c000'>The animal made straight for Dick, as if to
knock the boy down or bite him. But there was
another cartridge in the revolver, and this
finished the porker by cutting through his windpipe.
There was a grunt and a dying kick or
two, and then all was over.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attack had been short, but Dick was ready
to collapse. "I was afraid it was a bear," he
said, in telling of it afterward.</p>

<p class='c000'>On his former outings, the youth had learned
how to skin and carve almost any animal, and
now he drew out his clasp knife and went to
work, more to keep himself awake than anything,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>for he was afraid to go to sleep again.
Some of the pork fat he threw on the fire, which
now blazed up more brightly than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly the night wore away, until, looking at
his watch the youth saw that it lacked but a
short while to sunrise. Already the birds were
tuning up, while the croaking of the frogs
stopped as it grew lighter in the east.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as it was daylight, Dick cut off several
pork chops and broiled them over the fire
for breakfast, washing down the meat with a
drink from a pool in the hollow. Then he resolved
to climb one of the tallest of the trees,
to take a general view of his situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Climbing came easy to him, especially as the
tree he selected had numerous branches, some
growing quite closely to the ground. Once in
the top, he was enabled to see a goodly distance
on all sides of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over to his left was the valley, with the river,
where he had left Bob and Danny. To the right
was the mountain, and almost in front of him
the slope down which he had rolled so unceremoniously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not a soul in sight," he mused, when some
objects moving along the trail caught his eye.
He watched them for several minutes and distinguished
three men—a white man and two
blacks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>"Can it be Joseph Farvel and his helper and
guide?" he asked himself; and finally concluded
that it must be the party mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>He determined to watch them, to see how they
would head. They were coming from the
mountain, and as they came closer he saw that
they no longer carried their ropes and torches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently the three men disappeared, at the
point in the trail which was nearest to Dick.
He waited for them to reappear, but nobody
came to view.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's queer where they went to," he thought,
and continued to watch. At last he grew tired,
and determined to see if he could not find his
way back to where he had left Bob and Danny,
certain that they would not go on until they
heard from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that the sun was up it was an easy matter
for Dick to strike a straight path. Before
setting out, he cut off a good-sized piece of pork,
satisfied that his chums would enjoy a change
in diet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick's journey took him along a bit of rocky
ground and then through a deep hollow, where
the brush was so thick he could scarcely fight
his way along. Indeed, once he grew so tangled
up he had to use his pocketknife in clearing
himself, while the briars tore his clothing in
several places.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>"I want no more Porto Rican jungles after
this," he muttered. "One experience is enough.
If we ever lay hands on that treasure, it won't
be worth any more than the trouble of getting
it."</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of birds were flying over his head,
and had he been out for sport with a shotgun
he could have brought down several bagsful of
the saucy creatures, which even dared to circle
directly before his face. But with Joseph Farvel
so close at hand he did not deem it prudent
to fire his pistol even in fun.</p>

<p class='c000'>The end of the jungle reached, Dick came out
into an open patch probably a hundred feet in
circumference. It was covered with moss,
and unsuspicious of danger he started to cross
to the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the moss only covered one of the most
treacherous of bogs, and the youth had scarcely
covered fifteen feet of the distance than he sank
up to his ankles in the sticky soil. Growing
alarmed, he tried to turn back, only to find himself
glued to the spot, and sinking deeper and
deeper with every movement made to extricate
himself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> AN UNPLEASANT TALK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"What shall I do now?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick asked himself the question several times.
Here he was up to the knees in the bog and unable
to stir either foot an inch forward or backward.</p>

<p class='c000'>In vain he caught at the moss around him.
It came up in his hands, revealing only more
muck, black, slippery and pasty.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I stay here much longer I'll be planted for
good," he groaned. "Oh, I must get out somehow!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He struggled again and pulled with might
and main upon one foot. But as that member
came up, the other went down just so much
deeper, and in new alarm he set down both feet
again, to find himself now almost up to his
waist.</p>

<p class='c000'>His struggles had disturbed several swamp
crabs—dirty and ugly looking creatures, peculiar
to Porto Rico and other West India Islands.
They crawled all around him, hissing viciously
and glaring at him with their hard, beady eyes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>When he shouted at them, however, they scuttled
off as fast as their long legs permitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time that followed was an age to Dick,
who could not think of a thing to do. But he
did think of something else—snakes—and wondered
if any were at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If they come this way I'll be a goner!" he
shuddered. Then he raised his voice and called
out, not once, but again and again, until his
throat grew husky from his exertions.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last he heard an answering shout and his
heart gave a bound of joy. But then it sank
almost as much as before, as he saw Joseph
Farvel approaching, accompanied by one of his
black guides.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who calls?" cried Farvel, and then caught
sight of him. "You!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, Farvel. Please help me out of this?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"How did you get into such a box?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I tried to pass over the moss, not dreaming
of what was underneath. Will you help me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where are your companions?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I left them at the camp where you first saw
us."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't mean the boys. I mean Robert Menden
and those who went off with him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't know where they are."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where did they go yesterday afternoon?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't know."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Joseph Farvel's face darkened into that ugly
look which Dick had before noticed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I want a true answer, boy!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have told you the truth."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You know as well as I what brought Robert
Menden to this island and this locality."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I want to know just where he went yesterday
afternoon."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't know. I wasn't with him, and I
haven't seen him since yesterday morning."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He didn't return to your camp?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can't say that either. I left my friends,
wandered off, and got lost in these woods, and
I've been here all night, although not in this
swamp."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Humph!" Farvel mused for a moment and
sat down on a fallen tree. "Can you tell me
how Menden got to Porto Rico?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Aren't you going to help me out?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will—if you'll answer my questions."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He was picked up out of the ocean by some
folks on a yacht, and those folks brought him
to San Juan."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you know what he had to say for himself
when he was picked up?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He thinks he was shoved overboard from the
steamship."</p>

<p class='c000'>At this Joseph Farvel started, but as quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>recovered, and gave a hollow, unnatural laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Robert Menden always was full of queer
ideas. He was sick, and even the captain of the
steamship thought he acted queerly. You know
his story, but you don't know mine. What both
of us are after here belongs to me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I guess it will belong to the first man who
finds it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Farvel grated his teeth. "It belongs
to me—and I will have it. Now tell me where
Menden is at this moment."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I haven't the least idea."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You want me to rescue you, don't you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Would you be inhuman enough to leave me
to such a fate as this?" demanded Dick, in
horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You got yourself in this box—I had nothing
to do with it. How can you expect me to help
you if you are not willing to help me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can do nothing for you, Joseph Farvel.
But I would not leave a dog in such a helpless
situation as this."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would—if the dog stood ready to do me an
injury—and that is what you are ready to do,
in helping Robert Menden."</p>

<p class='c000'>So speaking, Farvel withdrew to a distance
and consulted in a low tone with the Carib who
accompanied him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The negro nodded, and then both hurried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>away through the wood at the top of their speed,
leaving Dick once more alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the youth had been downcast before he was
doubly so now. He was up to his armpits in
the swamp, and such a thing as getting out
alone was entirely out of the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now something welcome broke upon his
ears. From afar came the bark of a dog. It
was Dash, who had been sent to follow up his
trail; and a few minutes later the faithful animal
came into appearance from the direction
of the wood where the boy had spent the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dash! Good dog!" cried Dick, and Dash
came bounding toward him. Luckily the dog
was not so heavy but that the moss would support
him, although he had to move around with
care.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are you alone, Dash?" asked Dick, and the
dog set up a lone howl, at the same time pointing
his nose into the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bring Bob, Dash! Bob or Leander, Dash.
Bob! Leander! Run, Dash, go!" And understanding
perfectly, the intelligent canine
started off at a loping gait across the valley and
over to the camp by the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Dick it seemed that Dash would never
come back. The sun mounted higher and
higher in the sky until it poured directly down
upon the youth. He was tremendously thirsty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and would have given almost anything for a
drink of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had sunk lower, so now only his head was
above the top of the swamp. The water was
beginning to collect about him, and he felt that
before sunset he must drown, if he were not
rescued. Oh, how bitterly he regretted having
attempted to cross the quagmire.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was that? Dash's bark again, and he
set up a faint shout. Then he listened and
heard the voices of Bob and old Jacob, and once
more his hopes revived as by a shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This way, Bob! This way, Jacob! Hurry
up!" he called, and then his friends came into
view.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Dick, what a situation!" ejaculated
Bob. "Can't you help yourself?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not a bit."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We must be a-doin' somethin' fer him, an'
mighty quick, too," burst out old Jacob. "It's
a lucky thing I've got this rope with me," and
he pointed to a long coil suspended over his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>How to rescue Dick from his unpleasant situation
was a problem; but the old sailor finally
solved it by climbing a large tree which overlooked
the swamp close to where Dick was a
prisoner. Crawling far out on a stout branch,
he threw one end of his rope to the unfortunate
boy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Dick caught the rope with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can ye tie it under yer arms?" asked old
Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll try," was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a difficult undertaking, and by the
time it was accomplished the youth was up to
his chin in the dirty water which was collecting
in the quagmire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All ready!" he shouted feebly.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once old Jacob began to pull away.
"Wish I had a single tackle," he panted. "A
straight haul o' this sort ain't no easy job."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob had climbed into the tree to help him, yet
he could do but little, old Jacob being afraid
that the limb would break down with their combined
weights, added to the strain from the rope,
which was now drawn as tight as a washline.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps it will break," shouted Dick, warningly;
but the rope had been selected with great
care, and it held well. A long pull, and Dick
began to leave the quagmire, the rope pressing
against him as if to cut him in two.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hurrah! he's coming!" shouted Bob, presently,
and he was right. With a sudden sucking
sound, Dick left the muck and water behind,
and then, held up by the rope, stepped quickly
to a place of safety; and the rescue had been
accomplished.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> THE SEARCH FOR THE SPANISH TREASURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For a quarter of an hour after reaching a
place of safety Dick could only lay on the
ground panting for breath and trying to regain
his strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>His lower limbs were cramped and swollen,
and when he finally stood up, his feet felt as
though a thousand needles were piercing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never mind; you'll be all right by to-morrow,"
said old Jacob, kindly. "I'm glad we
found ye in time."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So am I, Jacob. I think, though, that Dash
deserves a good bit of praise;" and he patted the
dog affectionately on the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>While resting, Dick told of the encounter with
Joseph Farvel. Then he asked what had become
of Menden and the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They are all in camp up on the mountainside,"
answered Bob. "They made a tour of one
small cave yesterday, but found nothing. We
were all going out to-day, but went off on a
hunt for you instead."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If Robert Menden is smart he will lose no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>time. Joseph Farvel means to get that treasure
if he can."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, I reckon it's going to be a neck and
neck race," said Bob. "All I hope is, that Menden
proves to be the winner."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not until sunset that Dick found himself
in the new camp. All were glad to see him
and listened with deep interest to the story he
had to relate.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have received a taste of the sort of man
Farvel is," was Robert Menden's comment.
"Do you wonder now why I thoroughly dislike
the fellow?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, I don't wonder," answered Dick; "and
after this I'm going to try harder than ever to
keep that treasure out of his reach."</p>

<p class='c000'>That night both Dick and Danny slept soundly
and in the morning felt once more like themselves.
It was resolved that in the future, if it
was possible to do so, the whole party should
keep together.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And one man must remain on guard constantly,"
added Robert Menden. "If not, Joseph
Farvel may treat us to a disagreeable surprise."</p>

<p class='c000'>The party had, the day before, explored a
small cave but a short distance from the river.
It was now decided to let Remora take them to
the great Dark Cave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The path was a winding, tortuous one, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>they had to proceed with great care, especially
as all wanted to avoid even the semblance of
another mishap.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was clear, and from one point where they
stopped to take a rest they could see for miles.
Far away to the north they beheld the church
spires of San Juan, and beyond the rolling sea,
shining brightly in the sunlight. On all sides
were the rolling hills and sharp-backed mountains,
clothed in living green of all shades.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What an immense island for stock raising!"
murmured Leander. "A fellow could have
thousands of heads of cattle here. Just look at
the thickness of the grass."</p>

<p class='c000'>"This land will all be given over to coffee and
sugar plantations in time," said Robert Menden.
"Nine people out of ten care to raise
nothing else."</p>

<p class='c000'>They were resting under a big calabash tree
laden with green fruit. Now they resumed their
journey, through brush and stubble, for the
trail had gradually scattered and been lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last they approached a cliff all of two hundred
feet in height. Before the cliff were great
piles of rocks, overgrown with vines and gray
moss. Behind one mass of rocks was a yawning
hole not over six feet square.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dat is one of de doors to de Dark Cave," announced
Carlos Remora. "Now we light torch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>please you;" and they halted while he fired up.
The torch was a stick several feet in length and
smeared over with a sticky gum. Carlos carried
several, and all of the others had at least
one apiece, tied over his shoulder, and all carried
a goodly supply of matches in addition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The descent into the cave was a gradual one
for forty or fifty feet. Beyond the opening the
cavern broadened out and became much higher.
At the end of the descent there was a drop of a
few feet, and after this the flooring proved quite
level for over half a mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have a care of de birds!" shouted Remora.
He meant the bats, which were circling in all
directions over their heads. Near the entrance
the Dark Cave is filled with them, and sometimes
they brush against the visitor with their
skinny wings, producing anything but a pleasant
sensation. It was a bat which had knocked
out the eye of the native before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>On they went, over a flooring of dark stone,
reeking with wet, mould and slime. Overhead
hung stalactites of lime rock, tinged with
various colors from the minerals which lie hidden
in these mountains of Porto Rico. In one
spot a stalactite had fallen, and they picked it
up and brushed it off, to find it of a rainbow hue,
beautiful beyond description.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I should think those stalactites would alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>be worth something," observed Bob. "They
would make beautiful house ornaments, were
they properly cleaned."</p>

<p class='c000'>"They wouldn't stand the outer air long," answered
Dick. "Such rock never does."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Great Cæsar! what a cave!" exclaimed Don,
after they had been travelling for a mile or
more. "This is a regular underground world."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have not seen it all yet, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>," replied
Carlos Remora. "Da werry long, werry broad."</p>

<p class='c000'>All had their eyes open as they advanced,
looking for a long, flat stone, with a cross cut
upon it and the initials M. M. M.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden had questioned Remora on
this point, but the Porto Rican had assured him
that he had never seen such a stone, and added
that he doubted if there were any carvings in
the cave. "Only werry few come here," he had
concluded. "Most men afraid of de dark."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It would be very beastly down here without
a light," said Menden, as they paused in front
of a yawning hole a dozen or more feet in diameter.
"Where does that lead to, Remora?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The native shook his head. "Can't say about
dat. Nobody ever go down dem. Hark!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He picked up a loose stone and hurled it down
the opening. They heard it rebound from one
wall to another a dozen times, the sound growing
fainter and fainter until it died out altogether.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>"That's awful!" whispered Leander, as he
drew back. "That must lead to the center of
the earth."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nonsense, Leander," replied Dick. "But
it's pretty deep, I admit."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are there many such holes?" asked Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So many," the guide held up the fingers of
both hands. "But dis is de big one. Everybody
afraid of him;" and he walked on, unwilling
even to remain in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>From a distance came the sound of falling
water, and presently they came to a tiny waterfall.
Below was a pool of inky blackness and
a small underground watercourse, which disappeared
under the wall of the cavern a hundred
yards away.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I reckon dis knocks out de Mammoth Cave
uf Kentucky," said Danny. "Why yer could
build a hull city down here, dat's wot yer
could!"</p>

<p class='c000'>They had now reached the end of one branch
of the cave, and turned back to try another
branch. Soon they reached a point where the
flooring was very wet and the drops of water
came down steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We under ribber now," explained Remora.
"Some day water come down in big heap and fill
cave."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where does this water go to?" asked Don.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>"Go to little ribber at waterfall."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see. Do you think it safe here with this
water coming down?"</p>

<p class='c000'>At this question the guide merely shrugged
his shoulders. To his way of thinking no portion
of the cave was safe, and only the thought
of getting good pay for his services made him
stick to the exploring party.</p>

<p class='c000'>By one o'clock everybody was tremendously
hungry, and all hands sat down in a comparatively
dry spot to consume the lunch which
had been brought along. There was also a pot
of coffee, and by holding this over a couple of
torches it was warmed up, and each had a cup
of the beverage which, as old Jacob expressed
it, "struck right ter hum in thet cold, forlorn
region."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So far, no luck," said Robert Menden, in
disappointed tones. "I'm afraid I've led you
all on something of a wild-goose chase."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You musn't get discouraged too quickly," replied
Dick. "Remember, treasure boxes aren't
to be picked up every day."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I had no idea that the caves of Porto Rico
were so vast. The more I see of them the more
I am astonished."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've been thinking that perhaps the treasure
is down in a cave below this," put in Bob.
"We ought to try some of those holes before we
leave."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>"I intend to do so. But we had better finish
our examination of this cave first."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It might be as how the natives carted thet
treasure off long ago," ventured old Jacob.
"Like as not somebody else knew of it besides
the chap you met in Madrid."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, all we can continue to do is to hunt,"
said Don. "I'm not discouraged yet by any
means. If we—Hark!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He broke off short, as the sound of a distant
voice reached his ear. All listened intently.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is Joseph Farvel approaching!" whispered
Robert Menden. "He has either followed
us with his guides, or else he is making a search
on his own account."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Farvel!" exclaimed one and another of the
boys, and Dick felt for his pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What shall we do—let the feller see us?" demanded
old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Would that be wise?" queried the Englishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I should calkerlate not."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then let us get out of sight with all possible
speed," put in Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not far away was a gloomy looking recess
and into this they made their way. The
torches were extinguished, leaving them in absolute
darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't walk about," cautioned Dick. "If
you do you may take a nasty tumble."</p>

<p class='c000'>The caution was unnecessary, for the intense
darkness made everybody stand as still as a
statue. Listening, they heard Joseph Farvel
moving along slowly. Then by the aid of the
advancing lights, they saw he was accompanied
by both of his former negro companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ha! what is that?" muttered the man suddenly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and they saw him pick up something.
"A crust of fresh bread! Somebody has been
down here. I'll wager it was Menden's party."</p>

<p class='c000'>He continued to mutter to himself, but they
caught no more of his words.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Too bad I didn't eat that crust up," murmured
Don. "But I've got some canker sores
in my mouth and it was rather dry."</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Farvel halted his party and peered
around anxiously. But our friends kept out of
sight and he discovered nothing of them. In a
minute more he went on; and that was the last
they saw or heard of him for the time being.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He won't discover anything in that direction—at
least, not if he covers the ground we
covered," grinned Leander. "We were wide-awake
and I don't believe anything escaped us."</p>

<p class='c000'>They now turned off into another branch of
the great cave—a long, narrow opening twenty
to thirty feet in height. Here the rocky formation
was soft and crumbling, and they had
to pick their way with care.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A slight shock would send down tons and
tons of that stuff," said Robert Menden, as he
pointed to the loose masses hanging as by
threads over their heads. "Ugh! it gives a fellow
the shivers to look at it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Remora did not wish to enter. "No, no, come
back!" he cried. "Him no safe!" But they lit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>their own torches and went on, feeling every
foot of the way, while the Porto Rican remained
at the entrance to await their return.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flooring sloped downward, and presently
they found themselves traversing a circuitous
way, which seemed to lead, so Don declared, to
the very bowels of the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't slip," came from old Jacob. "If ye
do——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You'll have a worse roll than I had on the
mountainside," finished Dick. "No, thank you;
once was enough for me."</p>

<p class='c000'>But at last they reached a level again. Here
the lower cave was not over five to six feet wide,
but of such a height that the torches failed to
light up the ceiling. The opening seemed to be
a winding one and without end.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If we don't look out, we'll get lost," said
Bob. "We must be an awful way from the entrance."</p>

<p class='c000'>As they advanced, Robert Menden threw
down a little crushed rice, with which he had
filled several of his pockets. "We can follow
that trail back, if the worst comes to the worst,"
he declared. "But it will be a long and tedious
work."</p>

<p class='c000'>They had now another stream to cross. The
water was clear and cold, and all stopped for
a drink.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Danny was the last to bend down to get his
fill. He had not yet finished when he started
back and gave a yell.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wot's dat t'ing?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What thing?" they asked in chorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't yer see it—agin de wall. It's comin'
dis way!" and the Irish boy started to retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>All looked in the direction he pointed out and
saw something like an enormous crab coming
toward them. It was hissing viciously and was
as repulsive a creature as they had yet beheld.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bang! it was the report of Don's pistol, and
the thing was pierced through the body and
killed instantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A good shot—" began Leander, when Dick
and old Jacob both gave a cry of alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Look out, the roof is coming down! Run
for your lives!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Crash! Boom! Down came some of the
loose rock behind them, and by instinct more
than reason, they leaped across the underground
watercourse, Don falling in, but quickly
picking himself out again. They had scarcely
advanced to a safe distance when there came
another cracking and a dull rumble, and the
entire passageway at the spot where they had
stood but a minute before was choked up!</p>

<p class='c000'>For the time being, all were too dazed and bewildered
to do more than gaze in open-mouthed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>wonder at the destruction before them. The
air was filled with dust and dirt which blinded
and choked them, and then came a sickening
odor of released gases.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious, I didn't suppose a pistol shot
would do so much!" murmured Don, when he
could find his voice. "A quarry blast would
bring the whole thing down, I suppose."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We were lucky to escape with our lives,"
said Robert Menden. "No, it doesn't do to make
too much noise in a cave like this. The sound
waves are almost certain to loosen something
overhead."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think this has placed us in a putty bad
pickle," said old Jacob, seriously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you mean?" asked Bob. Then his
face blanched. "Are we—we—hemmed in?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Thet's about the size on it—to my way o'
reckonin'."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have the fallen rocks really closed up the
passageway?" queried Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"O' course we can't say till we investigate,
Mr. Menden. But it looks thet way from here,"
came from the old tar.</p>

<p class='c000'>They wished to investigate at once; but old
Jacob held them back. "More rocks might be
a-comin' down. Take yer time—it will pay in
the end." And they waited quarter of an hour
longer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>At last they crossed the watercourse again
and began to climb over the fallen mass, with
their torches held aloof, watching for an opening.
The climbing was dangerous, and more
than once one or another came near to twisting
his ankle or having his hand crushed, as the
rocks began to settle one over another.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here we are!" cried Robert Menden at last,
and pointed to an opening some distance away.
It was small, and they had to pass through in
single file; yet all breathed long sighs of relief
when they were on the opposite side.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think we have investigated that branch as
far as necessary—at least for the present," said
Robert Menden. He looked at his watch.
"Five o'clock!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Reckon we had better make fer the open air,"
was old Jacob's comment. "We have been
down here long enough fer this day;" and the
others agreed with him. Hunting for the
treasure was not such an agreeable task as they
had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a long and tedious journey to where
they had left Carlos Remora, and when they
reached the spot the Porto Rican was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll wager he heard the downfall of rocks
and made up his mind that we were all killed,"
said Leander; and he hit the nail exactly on the
head, as was later proven.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>There was now nothing left to do but to find
the mouth of the great cave alone. They proceeded
with caution, not wishing to make any
false turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see the opening!" cried Dick, at last. He
was right; and ten minutes later they were
scrambling out into the open air.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, how good it feels once more!" remarked
Don, as he inflated his lungs. "It's all well
enough to go down there and hunt for money,
but I prefer the open air every time."</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun was beginning to set in the west. To
the southward, dark clouds were beginning to
loom up. Old Jacob watched the clouds with
care.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you think of them?" asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you think, Dick?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I should say there was a good bit of wind
coming and, maybe, some rain."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And I should say you were right, lad; and
both won't be long a-comin'," concluded the
Yankee tar.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> A HURRICANE ON THE MOUNTAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The party watched the oncoming of the
storm with anxiety, for they felt that a downpour
on the top of that high mountain would
be no light affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Danny had began to build a fire preparatory
to cooking the evening meal, but now old Jacob
stopped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is an overhanging cliff," he said,
pointing with his long finger. "We had better
look for shelter there afore we think of eating."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are right," said Robert Menden. "This
coming storm may prove what the boys would
call a corker."</p>

<p class='c000'>They took up their traps, which had been hidden
in the brush while they were in the cave,
and set off for the cliff which loomed up less
than quarter of a mile away. It was a difficult
road, through brush and creeping vines and
over rough rocks, and before it was finished, the
big raindrops were beginning to patter down on
the broad tropical leaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here's a pretty good place," said Dick, pointing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to a hollowed-out spot eight or more feet in
depth. There were several wild plantains in
front of it, and it certainly looked a very good
shelter.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can't make no fire here," said Danny. "De
rain will put it out in no time."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Build up close to the rocks, Danny," replied
Don. "Here, I will show you;" and soon they
had a fairly good blaze started, and Danny
placed some water to boil.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the storm was on them in all of
its fury. The rain came down in sheets, so that
they could not see fifty feet in front of them.
The wind made the trees groan and creak as it
swayed them in one direction or another.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is a small-sized hurricane, I reckon,"
observed old Jacob. "Hark!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He put up his hand and they all listened.
From afar came a dull, humming sound. It
was coming closer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a hurricane, ez sure ez guns!" shouted
the Yankee sailor. "I hope we are safe here."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We ought to be," replied Leander. "Oh,
my! Listen!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The humming seemed to fill the air all around
them, while the sky grew as black as night.
Then came a wild rushing of wind and at a distance
they heard several forest trees go down
with a crash. A tree directly before their shelter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>followed, and then the full force of the hurricane
was upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a twinkle, one and another of the boys
found himself lifted up and dashed against the
rocks. The wind soused the rain in all around
them, and the embers of the fire were hurled
hither and thither, some sailing up into the air
to disappear in the raging element. In front
of the shelter the brush was torn up by the roots,
and the very rocks seemed to quake and quiver,
as if about to tumble down upon their heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is fearful!" groaned Bob; but nobody
heard him, nor were the remarks from the others
audible. The wind had found a crack in
the rocks and through this it was whistling with
the loudness of a steam calliope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swish! crack! bang! down came another tree
before their hiding-place, and the uppermost
branches were thrust at them, hemming all in
against the wall. But this gave additional
shelter, and now the wind that came after could
not reach them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few minutes the first fury of the hurricane
was spent; but it continued to blow and
rain at a lively rate, and this kept up until almost
morning. To make even a torch-light was
impossible, and they huddled together in the
dark, side by side, with their backs to the cliff,
silently praying that God might see them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>through this peril in safety. And their prayer
was heard; for morning found them wet, sleepy
and hungry, but still unharmed by a hurricane
which, in other quarters, had done untold
damage.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My gracious! that was worse than the blizzard
we had on Snow-Top Island!" declared
Leander. "I'll tell you what—I wouldn't want
to be out in the Dashaway in such a blow."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I trust the storm ain't found the yacht," replied
old Jacob, dubiously. "If it got in the
harbor it would play high jinks with the shipping."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I hope it passed by San Juan," said
Dick. The Dashaway was his pride, and he did
not wish to see the beautiful vessel harmed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was with difficulty that the entire party
found enough dry wood with which to kindle a
fire. All were soaked to the skin, and it was
decided to remain in camp until noon.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps we would have been better off in the
cave," said Bob. "I wonder if Joseph Farvel
remained down there."</p>

<p class='c000'>"As like as not," said Robert Menden. "But
I think staying in such a hole in a hurricane is
dangerous. You don't know what pranks a
storm might play."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; if the wind got in there it would haul
down a good bit o' the roof," said old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>While Danny was nursing the fire into a big
blaze, several flocks of birds flew over the cliff.
At once the boys got out their firearms and
half a dozen shots brought down twice that
number of the feathered specie. The birds were
speedily dressed, and cooked, and made a welcome
addition to their otherwise scant breakfast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden was anxious that no more
time be lost, and promptly at noon, with clothing
once more dried, they started off again for
the caves. Carlos Remora had disappeared entirely,
nor did he show up again, thinking that
all of the party were buried under the fallen
ceiling of the cave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The side of the mountain was wet and slippery,
and they had to proceed with care, for
fear of slipping into some hollow and becoming
seriously hurt.</p>

<p class='c000'>On all sides were the evidences of the terrific
storm—shattered trees, bushes laid flat,
and here and there a ripped-up portion of grass,
as if some giant's hand had reached down and
twisted it up from the roots.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's wonderful what a power the wind has
when it lets itself loose," remarked Dick. "I'm
awfully glad we weren't caught out in the
open."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's so," said Don. "We would have been
blown to Kingdom Come."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>When they reached the entrance to the Dark
Cave they looked around for some trace of
Remora and of Joseph Farvel's party; but the
storm had obliterated all footprints and other
signs.</p>

<p class='c000'>With lighted torches they passed inside and
down the first slope, which was now familiar to
them. Their future operations had been talked
over during the breakfast hour, and it had been
decided to try a central branch of the great cave—one
which Carlos Remora had told them had
a very uneven flooring and was, consequently,
but little travelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had just reached the ending of the first
slope when Dick saw a white object sticking
up on the end of a stick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hullo! what's that?" he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's what, Dick?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That thing on the stick?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a sign of some sort," exclaimed Bob;
and running forward he held the torch to it.
It proved to be a piece of white paper stuck on
a bit of tree bark. On the paper was written:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>"WARNING!</div>

<p class='c010'>"Be it known to all that I, by right of inheritance

<p class='c000'>"Oh, what cheek!" burst out Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He had better claim the earth and have done
with it," put in Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will you pay any attention to that?" asked
Don, turning to Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you think I should?" queried the Englishman,
with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nixey," cried Danny, who could not always
get away from his old-time slang.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He hasn't any more right here nor any o'
us," burst out old Jacob. "Jest let him try to
stop me, thet's all. He'll reckon he fell in with
a second hurricane!"</p>

<p class='c000'>At this they all laughed. And that laugh
settled matters. They would go ahead and pay
no attention to the warning left by their enemy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> THE CHAMBER OF BONES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On they went, the flooring under their feet
showing that a good deal of the rain had washed
into the cavern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden was ahead with one torch,
while old Jacob brought up in the rear with the
second light.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between, the boys were spread out in a semicircle,
each looking with all his might for anything
that might resemble a long, flat stone,
with a cross and the three M's cut upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along with Dick trotted Dash, his ears up,
as if as ready as any of them to make an important
discovery, did it lay in his power.</p>

<p class='c000'>A quarter of a mile was covered, when they
reached the branch for which they were searching.
In the meantime Robert Menden had left
a trail of crushed rice, that they might thereby
find their way back.</p>

<p class='c000'>They now found it necessary to climb over
jagged rocks as high as their heads and higher—laborious
work which soon put all in a state
of perspiration.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>"I guess this is about as hard as working in a
coal mine," said Don. "I hope the rocks come
to an end soon."</p>

<p class='c000'>"This flooring has been thrown up by an
earthquake," observed Robert Menden. "We
must be careful, or somebody may fall through
some fissure. And don't wander away, whatever
else you do."</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys promised to be careful. But Menden's
warning was not needed, for in that
gloomy spot they were perfectly willing to keep
close to one another and could not have been
hired to separate.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I believe we are coming to the end of this
branch," said Dick, half an hour later.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is a small opening to the left," replied
the Englishman. "We will try that;" and as
before, he led the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>A narrow passageway was passed, and they
came into a round chamber fifty feet or more in
diameter. From overhead the water dripped
constantly, and curious spiders and black bugs
ran hither and thither, as the party approached
with their torches.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, my! Look!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The cry came from Don, and was taken up by
several of the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We've struck a cemetery of bones," said Bob;
and he was right. On all sides of the chamber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>were piles of bones, with here and there a row
of skeleton heads!</p>

<p class='c000'>"There must be nigh onto a thousand o' 'em,"
muttered old Jacob, as he surveyed the scene.
"Never saw sech a tarnal sight in my life!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's certainly a grim spectacle," returned
Robert Menden. "I wonder how they happened
to place these bones here?"</p>

<p class='c000'>No one could answer that question. They
hunted around for bits of clothing and jewelry,
but none came to sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This ain't to my taste," said old Jacob—"let
us go on;" and on they went to a small
cavern beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the air was foul and unwholesome, and
even the torches refused to burn, saving with a
yellow, uncertain light.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can't stand much of this," said Leander.
"I feel as if I was in a tomb."</p>

<p class='c000'>He had scarcely spoken when Dick pointed
out some bones lying in a corner of the chamber.
Coming closer, they made out the skeleton of a
man. Beside the bones lay several patches of
clothing and a pair of old-fashioned iron-rimmed
spectacles.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That man lost his life here, sure," said Bob.
"Look; one of his leg-bones is broken in half."</p>

<p class='c000'>"More than likely he broke his leg and found
it impossible to walk further," said Don. "And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>then I suppose his light and food gave out, and
he starved to death. Horrible!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't want to see any more of it," said
Don, shuddering. "I guess he was an old man,
otherwise he wouldn't have had those iron-rimmed
spectacles. I suppose that skeleton has
been here for a dozen years."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick was bending down over the bones, having
seen something shining near one of the fleshless
hands. He picked the object up and found
it to be a long, flat, brass key.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A key!" cried Robert Menden. He took the
thing from the youth, and held it close to the
torch. "By the queen!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's up?" came in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"See! The key is marked M. M. M. on one
side!" And he pointed out the initials.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It must belong to the treasure box!" ejaculated
Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hurrah! We're gittin' closer to dat prize!"
burst out Danny, and shook his bullet-like head
enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c000'>All examined the key with interest. It was
a little rusted at one end, but still good
enough to use if the cedar box was brought to
light, as Dick declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are on the right trail; I feel certain of
it," said Menden. "For that old Spaniard mentioned
a pile of bones to me."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>"I wonder if Farvel has been here yet?" said
Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think not—and I hope he doesn't come."</p>

<p class='c000'>They moved on more slowly than ever. The
foul air was now left behind and they gained a
chamber where there was a steady current of
cold air which made one and another shiver.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What's that?" said Don, of a sudden.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had heard a strange sound, and now they
all noticed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is it somebody moaning?" gasped Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It certainly sounds like it," said old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps it is Farvel in trouble," suggested
Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moaning rose and fell, as if a person was
in great pain and unable to cry out loudly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where does it come from?" was Dick's question.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one was able to answer, and they stood in
a mute crowd, looking at each other. Danny
gave a shiver.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't like dat nohow," he whispered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No more do I like it," muttered Leander.
"It sounds like a ghost!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't say dat, or I'll be fer runnin' away!"
cried the Irish lad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dash put up his nose and added a long whine.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is it, Dash?" said Dick. "Show it
to us, old boy!"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>The dog started forward, then stood stock
still and showed his teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was another moan and then a hiss, and
out of the gloom ahead shone two fiery eyes,
moving slowly from side to side.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Some beast!" shouted Robert Menden.
"Have your pistols ready!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He had scarcely uttered the words when a
big cat shot past him and landed on Leander's
left shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creature was of the domestic specie, but
evidently gone wild from hunger and loneliness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Help! take it off!" cried the boy, and tried
to clear himself. But the cat hung the closer.
Then it opened its mouth as if to bury its teeth
in his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>A report rang out. Robert Menden had
taken careful aim and fired. At once the cat
gave a screech and tumbled to the ground,
where it lay writhing and moaning. Another
shot put it out of its misery forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attack had taken Leander's nerve away
from him, and the boy sank down on a rock and
shivered, while turning as white as a sheet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was terrible!" he murmured. "Say, I'm
for getting out of this!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, don't talk that way, Len!" cried Bob.
"The cat's dead now, you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But there may be more of them."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>"I think not. She probably got in here by
accident."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And then that dead body, too!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't believe there are any more of those
either."</p>

<p class='c000'>"To be sure, it was very unpleasant," put in
Robert Menden. "But it will have to be something
far worse to turn me back."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And me," added Dick. "I am going to stick
to the hunt to the end."</p>

<p class='c000'>And five minutes later the whole party went
forward once more. But Leander kept close to
old Jacob, and carried his pistol where it could
be brought into instant use if required.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> THE TABLET OF STONE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>By consulting a watch they found that it was
after six o'clock; but they had brought supper
along and ate this in preference to making their
way out of the cave to their camp on the mountainside.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Farvel must not be allowed to get ahead of
us in this search," declared Robert Menden.
"If he once got the treasure in his possession,
the jig would be up, so far as we are concerned."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's queer we haven't seen anything of him
to-day," said Dick. "He must be in the cave
somewhere."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There are so many branches we can easily
keep apart," said Don. "It is like the branches
of a great tree lying flat underground."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And we are like ants looking for the right
branch," laughed Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I feel it in my bones that we have the right
branch here," put in Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"An' I feel thet way myself," added old Jacob.
"I think we'll have thet treasure in forty-eight
hours, or sooner."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Both torches had burnt low, and now they lit
fresh ones, which threw a brighter light on all
sides. They were moving along in a row when
the Englishman called a sudden halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is a wide crack in the rocks ahead,"
he declared. "Look out that somebody doesn't
tumble into it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Does it lead to the lower caves?" asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm sure I don't know, Dick. We can throw
down a stone and see."</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden was about to look around for
a suitable stone, when a cry from Bob caught
his ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The tablet!" yelled the boy. "Look! look!"</p>

<p class='c000'>All rushed to his side and gazed in the direction
that he pointed out. Sure enough, there
on the very brink of the crack Menden had
located, was a long, flat stone. At one end of
the stone they saw that a rude cross had been
carved. At the other end were the much sought-after
initials, M. M. M.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hurrah! the treasure at last!" cried Dick,
and felt like dancing a jig for joy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is the cedar box? I'm crazy to see
how much it has in it!" put in Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I guess we're all crazy for that," laughed
Leander, his scare having been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It ought to be under the tablet," said Robert
Menden. "Can the thing be lifted by hand?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>He examined the tablet, which rested on several
rocks set in the form of a square, one side
at the very opening just mentioned. The flat
stone was a heavy affair, weighing all of six or
seven hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ye can't budge thet by hand," said old Jacob,
who was almost as excited as the rest. "It will
take a block and fall, or a long lever, to do it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And we have neither!" groaned the Englishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>They stared at each other blankly. What was
to be done?</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps we can pull it away from the back,"
said Dick. "That is, if there is any way of fastening
the rope."</p>

<p class='c000'>As he spoke he reached across the tablet from
the front, and felt in the back.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By ginger! the back's hollow!" he burst out.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hollow?" came from several of the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, hollow. Here, give me one of the
torches and I'll take a look for the chest."</p>

<p class='c000'>The light was speedily thrust forward, and
while the others held him by the legs to keep
from sliding down into the crack beyond, Dick
made an inspection.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The hole under the tablet is empty!"</p>

<p class='c000'>A groan went up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Empty? Impossible!" said Robert Menden,
and his face grew as white as a sheet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>"Yes, the hole is empty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But—but—" began old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The bottom of the hole slopes toward the
crack," went on Dick. "I'll wager that when
the flooring parted, the cedar chest fell down to
the bottom of the split."</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a murmur of relief at this. Perhaps
the treasure was not lost after all.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us throw a piece of torch down and see,"
said Bob; and his advice was speedily carried
out. But the torch went down so far, its light
revealed little but grotesque shadows, which
might be treasure boxes or something else.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crack in the flooring was eight to ten feet
wide; but taking a run, Robert Menden cleared
the distance, and aided by a rope, several others
followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this side they could look into the hollow
under the tablet with ease. But this gave them
little satisfaction, for the opening was as empty
as Dick had mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've a good mind to try my luck with the
rope," said Robert Menden. "We brought it
along for the purpose of getting down holes, you
know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, we'll let ye down as carefully as possible,"
answered old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>A noose was made and slipped around Menden's
body, under his arms. Then a smooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>spot was selected, where the rope might run
without scraping, and the Englishman climbed
down over the edge.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now, lower away," he called out. "But go
slow, and don't let me slip away from you."</p>

<p class='c000'>He had a torch in one hand, while with the
other he kept himself from striking on the various
sharp projections which he encountered.
He went down twenty, thirty, forty feet, and
then to the very end of the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A little lower!" he cried, as those above
stopped and held fast to several knots previously
inserted in the rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can't put out any more," called down old
Jacob. "Ain't ye reached the bottom?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No; it's about ten or fifteen feet below this
point."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can ye see anything?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"See a lot of loose rock and—Yes, a corner
of a box. I think the fall broke the chest all to
pieces."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll haul ye up and git a longer rope," returned
the Yankee tar. "He's found the treasure
right enough," he added, to the boys gathered
around him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no easy task to bring Robert Menden
up to the flooring again, but at last it was accomplished,
and the Englishman untied himself,
none the worse for his trip to the region below.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>All greatly regretted there were no more
ropes at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If we had them we might get at that treasure
this very night," declared Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never mind; it's late," said old Jacob.
"We'll go back to camp and rest, and bring the
other ropes in by daylight. I reckon it won't
hurt the treasure to rest another twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But we want to know how much is there,
Jacob," said Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So we do—but we'll have to be patient."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, we had better go back," put in Robert
Menden. "But first let us cover that tablet with
loose rock, so if Joseph Farvel comes this way,
he won't discover it."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was considered good advice, and as loose
stones were plentiful they soon succeeded in hiding
the tablet entirely from view. Then the
spot was carefully marked by another means,
and they started once more for the outer air.</p>

<p class='c000'>The climb over the rough flooring tired them
thoroughly, and by the time the mouth of the
main cave was gained they could scarcely drag
one foot after the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll sleep to-night, no matter if it does blow,"
said Don. "But I guess I'll dream of a lot of
shining Spanish gold, too," he added, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>All were in the best of spirits, and several of
the boys began to whistle as they set off for the
camp on the mountainside. But this Robert
Menden stopped.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We want to do this thing as quietly as possible,"
he said. "Remember, we have both Joseph
Farvel and the Porto Rican brigands against
us. Even if we get hold of that treasure, we'll
have a job to get it safe to the city or on board
of the Dashaway."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob was in advance, knowing the trail pretty
thoroughly by this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner was the shelter under the rocks
gained than he let out a wild howl.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The things are all gone! Somebody has
robbed us!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob was right. During their absence the
camp had been visited by some thief, and now
everything, including the ropes and the cooking
utensils, as well as their supply of food, was
missing.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> LOOKING FOR THE CAMPING OUTFIT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For the moment, all stood aghast over the discovery
which had been made.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is Joseph Farvel's work!" cried Robert
Menden, when he could speak. "He means to
make us quit the search and go back to San
Juan."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The pesky rascal!" muttered old Jacob.
"Jest wish I could lay hands on him, thet's all!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is we ter do?" queried Danny. "I
can't git no supper wid nuthin' ter work wid."</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is certainly a bad fix," said Don. Then
he looked at Dash. "Too bad, eh, old boy?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I forgot Dash!" cried Dick. "I wonder if
he can't follow the trail of the thief?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To be sure he can," ejaculated Leander.
"Can't you, Dash?" And the dog wagged his
tail.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do we want to follow him?" questioned
Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We want our stuff back," answered Dick,
determinedly. "Besides, we can't do anything
in the cave without those other ropes."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>"Yes, let us follow the trail right now—if we
kin do it," said old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were all out of humor, being tired and
hungry, and had Joseph Farvel crossed their
path just then, it would have gone hard with the
man. But our friends had made a great mistake,
as we shall presently see.</p>

<p class='c000'>It took some little time to make Dash understand
what was wanted. But when Bob took a
bone and pointed at the fire, and at one plate
that had been left behind, the canine knew what
was wanted, and set off on a trot that made
them all hustle to keep up with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trail led over the very top of the mountain
and to a little bamboo shack on the other
side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody was in sight and they rightfully
guessed that the bamboo shelter was deserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Entering, they found all of their traps piled
up in a corner, together with some things which
did not belong to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here's our stuff, and more," cried Don.
"Good for Dash! He makes the best kind of a
detective."</p>

<p class='c000'>While they were sorting out their goods, old
Jacob, who was at the doorway, announced that
somebody was approaching.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a man, but who, I can't tell, it's that
dark," he said. "Better prepare to give him
a surprise."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>"I believe it's Farvel, and that this other stuff
is his," said Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as the newcomer came closer, all were
surprised to see, not Joseph Farvel, but Bumbum,
the good-for-nothing Carib.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We've made a big mistake," murmured Menden.
"I'd almost forgotten about this fellow."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, I've not forgotten him," said Leander,
grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor I," added Dick. "If he took this stuff,
let us bring him up with a round turn."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was agreed to hide, and they did so without
delay, behind a bush back of the hut.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bumbum approached rapidly, and lighting
a torch, entered the clumsy shelter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then taking a rope he began to tie together
all the articles belonging to the Dashaway's
party, as well as the other things.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Drop those, you rascal!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The command came from Dick, and turning,
the Carib found himself confronted by two men,
five boys and a dog.</p>

<p class='c000'>The articles in his hands fell to the dirt flooring
with a bang, and he staggered back in terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Americano</span></i>—" he began, but could get no
further.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So we've caught you in the act," said Leander.
"Pretty business for you to be in, isn't
it?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>"Bumbum no understand," stammered the
native.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You stole our outfit," came from Robert
Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bumbum no steal anyt'ing, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>. Bumbum
find t'ings on de mountain."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You can't make us believe that yarn," cried
Bob. "You knew the things belonged to us
when you took them. You're a first-class
sneak."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bumbum very honest, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>—nefer take
not'ing, nefer!" And the Carib nodded earnestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You took our ten dollars fast enough," said
Dick. He turned to the others. "Hadn't he
better give that money up?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, make him give it ye back," said old
Jacob. "He don't deserve a cent." And the
others agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Carib was made to understand
what was wanted, his face grew as dark as the
night outside. "You rob poor man—dat no
fair," he muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are a rascal and ought to be in jail," answered
Robert Menden. "Give the boys their
money back and be quick about it."</p>

<p class='c000'>But Bumbum was a miser, and rather than
part with a single <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">peseta</span></i>, he determined to try
running away. With a bound he reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>outside of the shack and started to run, when
Don tripped him up and sent him headlong.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short struggle ensued, but the Carib was
speedily overpowered, and then his hands were
bound behind him. In his pocket he had not
only the money Dick and Leander had been
forced to give him, but also the wallet stolen
from Joseph Farvel.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here is your money, lads," said Robert Menden,
as he handed the silver to the two boys.
"I must say I don't know what to do about Farvel's
wallet."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Keep it, until you have the chance to give it
back to him," suggested Bob; and this advice
was acted upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And now what's to do with this critter?" put
in old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He ought to be handed over to the authorities."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was certainly true, but the nearest
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">alcalde</span></i> was the one located at Aguas Buenas,
over five miles distant and they had no desire
to make such a trip that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let him go," said Leander, at last. "Boot
him out of camp, and tell him we'll have him arrested
if he ever shows up again."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All right," answered Robert Menden, and
Bumbum was released. A sharp quarrel of
words followed, and then the Carib slunk away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>in the darkness, more bitter against the entire
party than ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We want to keep our weather eyes open fer
thet chap," was old Jacob's comment. "He's
the sort as would knife ye in the back if he got
the chance."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was decided to remain at the bamboo hut
over night, and a blaze was speedily started and
supper prepared. Everybody was too tired to
go hunting or fishing, and the evening meal was,
consequently, a scant one.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is doubtful if any of the boys slept very
soundly that night. Each head was filled with
visions of the golden treasure, and each tried to
calculate mentally how much his share of the
expected find would amount to, after the necessary
expenses were paid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each had to stand guard for an hour, but
nothing happened to disturb them, and by sunrise
the camp was in motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A hasty breakfast, lads," cried Robert Menden.
"And then, ho! for the treasure."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And may it prove to be twice as large as expected,"
added Don.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> JOSEPH FARVEL MAKES A MOVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Breakfast was about over, and Danny was
beginning to wash the few dishes they had used,
when suddenly Bob leaped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Joseph Farvel, as sure as fate!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where?" demanded Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Coming through the brush back of us. See!
There he is!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The youth was right; Farvel was making
straight for the shack, followed by his two
negro companions. He looked dirty and tired
out, and his clothing was in tatters.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he beheld them he stared in amazement;
then halted, and drew his pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stop, Farvel; we want no shooting here,"
cried Robert Menden, sternly. "Put your firearm
back in your pocket."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a fine game you played on me," growled
Farvel, as he concealed his pistol and came
closer. "Thought you were mighty clever,
didn't you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't understand you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't you? See here; you can't play any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>such game on me, even if we are alone among
these mountains."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What are you driving at, Farvel?" asked
Dick, coming forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your crowd stole my traps—I see some of
them in the hut. I want them back." And the
fellow shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You can have your traps and welcome," said
Menden. "But we did not steal them. If they
were stolen, the job was done by a Carib named
Bumbum."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a likely story!" was the reply, with a
sneer. "Who is this Bumbum? I never heard
of him?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The man who waylaid you on the road and
robbed you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here is the wallet he took from you."</p>

<p class='c000'>The article was passed over to Joseph Farvel,
who accepted it with a cold stare. However, he
opened it quickly to see if the contents were
intact, and then smiled to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't understand your game at all," he
muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is no game, Farvel," said Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How did you get the wallet?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Our things were stolen and, aided by our
dog, we traced them here, where we found your
goods mixed up with our own. While we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>sorting out the stuff we saw this Bumbum approaching.
We hid in the bushes, and saw by
the way he acted that he had robbed both of us
and was going to tote his booty off. We collared
him, and on searching him got ten dollars
belonging to two of these boys, and your wallet.
That proves that he was the man who waylaid
you; otherwise, how would he have your wallet?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's an odd tale, Robert Menden," came
sullenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And a true one, whether you believe it or
not."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course I'll have to believe it. But I want
to talk to you about another matter."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All right. But hurry, as we don't intend to
spend all of our time here."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are hot-footed after that treasure, I
see."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have a right to be."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Didn't you see the notice I posted near the
entrance to the cave?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That notice isn't worth the paper it is written
on, Farvel. You might better have saved
your writing material."</p>

<p class='c000'>At this Joseph Farvel bit his lip. "Don't be
so sure of that, Menden."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We won't argue the point. I have given
you your wallet—for which I've got no thanks—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>there are your other goods. You had
better take them and yourself off."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll go when I please."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then we'll go, and you can live in the hut
and welcome," put in Dick. "Come, Danny,
make up your bundle, and I'll help you carry
it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you found anything of the treasure
yet?" asked Farvel, curiously, as he turned to
Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is none of your business."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll make it my business. The treasure is
mine, and nobody shall rob me of it," was the
fierce response.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That treasure will belong to the party that
finds it, Farvel," replied Robert Menden.
"Don't deceive yourself by thinking otherwise."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know what I'm talking about. But, see
here—" Farvel shifted uneasily from one foot
to the other. "What do you say to our doubling
up and dividing the treasure when we
locate it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>At this proposition all were greatly surprised.
Then they looked at Farvel's appearance, and
quickly came to the conclusion that the fellow
was growing discouraged.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We do not need your assistance, Farvel,"
said Menden. "We'll do as we've been doing—go
it alone."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>"You won't form a partnership?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think I can locate that treasure in another
day."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then go and do it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I—I've located the flat stone already."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What!" came in a chorus, and all of the
Dashaway's party were much dismayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, and I'll have the treasure box, and unless
you agree to assist me you won't get a
penny."</p>

<p class='c000'>"When did you locate the tablet?" queried
old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yesterday afternoon. I would have opened
it only——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Only what?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I didn't have the tools, and it was cemented
right in the wall of the cave."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Indeed!" The old tar put up his hand to
shut off the others from talking. "Farvel, I
think yer a natural born story-teller. You
ain't seed so much as a corner o' thet stone.
It's a put-up job to make us take ye into partnership—but
it won't work nohow."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Jacob Ropes is right," said Robert Menden.
"You haven't seen the tablet."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It ain't in no wall!" burst out Danny, ere he
had stopped to think twice. "It's—" He
stopped in dismay.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>"Ha! so you have located it!" cried Joseph
Farvel.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It ain't in no wall, fer de papers don't read
dat way," went on Danny, bound to smooth
matters over. "It's behind a monument wid lions'
heads and carved snakes, and such t'ings
around it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A monument with lions' heads?" queried
Farvel, in bewilderment. "All right—if you
know best." He paused. "Then you won't
form any partnership?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," said Robert Menden; and all of the
others agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without another word, Joseph Farvel ordered
his helpers to gather his things together. He
was on the point of appropriating one of old
Jacob's ropes when the sailor stopped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Take yer own, an' no more," he said, sternly;
and Farvel dropped the coil. In a minute more
he and his party made off and soon disappeared
over the mountain top.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That was a bad break, Danny," said Dick,
when Farvel was out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So it was," murmured the Irish lad. "But
I guess I t'rew him off de track wid dem lions'
heads an' snakes, don't you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps so; but be more careful in the
future."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think the best thing we can do is to hide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>our traps, after this," observed Leander. "Who
knows but what Bumbum or Farvel may be
after them."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That Carib may be watching us even now,"
said Don. "Let us search the bushes and see."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was done, but nobody was brought to
light. Then the outfit was hidden in a dense
hollow, under some vines, and off they started
for the Dark Cave once more, carrying all their
ropes, as well as a stout canvas bag, with them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> BOB IS TAKEN PRISONER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>They now felt thoroughly at home on the
mountain top, and set a straight course for the
Dark Cave.</p>

<p class='c000'>It promised to be an exceedingly warm day,
and they had not proceeded far before all were
bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is too bad," observed Don. "We won't
want to go underground while we are so hot.
We may get a chill."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can rest awhile at the entrance to the
cave," said Robert Menden. "We'll need it before
climbing over the rough rocks to where
that crack is located."</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching the entrance, they threw themselves
on a grassy bank in the shade to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although they did not know it, Joseph Farvel
was close at hand, and now watched them intently.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fellow felt that they had discovered something,
and wished to ascertain, if possible, just
what it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll dog them; see if I don't," he said to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>The negroes he had with him were brawny fellows,
willing to do almost anything he ordered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently Bob, feeling rested, sprang up and
began to walk around near the entrance to the
cave, and then toward a nearby pool of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>His course took him out of sight of his companions,
and close to where Farvel and the negroes
lay concealed in the tall grass and trailing
vines.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the boy approached, a sinister look came
over the man's face, and he whispered a few
words to his black companions. They evidently
understood, and nodded in agreement with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob had just procured his drink and was
watching the flight of several birds near by,
when he felt himself clutched from behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before he could make the slightest outcry a
hand was clapped over his mouth, and he was
lifted from his feet and borne into the jungle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob's eyes were wide open and he easily saw
who had made him captive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natives carried him with ease, while it
was Joseph Farvel's hand which was clapped
over his mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>After several hundred feet had been covered,
he was set down, and a handkerchief gag was
inserted in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Make an outcry and you will be sorry for it,"
said Joseph Farvel, grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Bob wished to ask where he was being taken,
but was given no chance to do so. The natives
bound his hands behind him, and then he was
told by Farvel to march.</p>

<p class='c000'>As there was nothing to be gained just then
by resisting, poor Bob marched along, through
the jungle and across several tiny mountain
streams.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently they reached a rough shelter built
of tree branches and palm leaves, and here they
halted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy was tied to a tree, hands and feet, the
natives using some tough vines for that purpose.
Then he was searched, and his pistol and
pocketknife were taken from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I ungag you, will you promise to make no
outcry?" asked Joseph Farvel.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Bob was nearly smothered, he nodded his
head, whereupon the obnoxious gag was quickly
removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you mean by handling me in this
fashion?" demanded the youth, as soon as he
could speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now don't get on a high horse, or it will be
the worse for you," replied Farvel, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I ask you a direct question and I expect a
direct answer," went on Bob, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I brought you here to get some information
from you, young man."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>"You'll learn nothing from me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps I shall."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll cut my tongue off before I tell anything."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's easy enough to talk that way now. But
you'll change your tune presently."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't think so."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll see. Do you realize that you are entirely
in my power?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That doesn't scare me so very much, Joseph
Farvel. You won't dare to do much."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am here for that treasure, and I'm bound
to have it by hook or by crook. If you know
anything definite, you had better tell me about
it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"As I said before, I'll tell you nothing."</p>

<p class='c000'>In a rage Farvel stepped closer and slapped
Bob's cheek.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You little rat, I'll make you talk!" he
stormed. "Your party has located the treasure;
I feel certain of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob was boiling with indignation, and had
his hands been free he would have knocked Farvel
down. But he was helpless, and could do
absolutely nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are you going to talk?" demanded the enraged
man, after a short pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't you know what is best for you?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>"Perhaps I do."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You act as if you didn't."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll chance it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You shan't have a mouthful to eat or to drink
until you promise to tell me all you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then I'll starve," said Bob, promptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Farvel had not looked for so much
grit in the youth, and now he was completely
nonplussed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You don't mean what you say."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Try me and see."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have your friends located that tablet?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go ask them, and find out—if you can."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't get cheeky. What is your name?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bob Hobart—I'm not ashamed of it either—as
I would be if my name was Joseph Farvel."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't anger me too greatly, or I'll—I'll——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What will you do?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll bring you to terms in a hurry."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You can't bring me to terms. And now let
me do a little talking. I demand that you set
me at liberty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go ahead and demand, and that is all the
good it will do you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If you continue to hold me a prisoner, when
I get free I'll have you arrested, just as sure as
you're an Englishman."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps you won't get the chance."</p>

<p class='c000'>So speaking, Farvel walked away, to consult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>with the blacks, one of whom immediately made
off in the direction of the Dark Cave.</p>

<p class='c000'>In vain Bob tugged at the vines which bound
him. They were as tough as iron and refused
to part. At last with a groan he gave up the
struggle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Half an hour passed, and then the second
negro left, and Farvel approached Bob once
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you changed your mind about talking?"
he demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have not."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If Robert Menden finds that treasure, are
you to have a part of it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"If you wish to know so bad—yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What part?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Robert Menden is going to give our party
one-quarter of all that is found."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Humph! I wouldn't be satisfied with a quarter."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We consider that the treasure is really his—if
he finds it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It belongs to me. Now I have a plan that
ought to interest you. If your party will drop
Menden and come with me, I'll give your crowd
one-half of all we get."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm not making a deal with you, Joseph Farvel.
I wouldn't go into partnership with you
for a million dollars."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>"Why not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because I don't like you and I don't think
you are honest. If you——"</p>

<p class='c000'>Bob was allowed to go no further. White
with rage, Farvel sprang forward and planted
a blow directly on the defenceless boy's nose.
The onslaught drew blood, which trickled down
over Bob's mouth and chin.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You coward!" moaned the boy, when Farvel
hauled off for another attack. But now an interruption
came, as welcome to the boy as it
was terrifying to Farvel. What it was we
shall speedily learn.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> A FRIEND IN NEED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Bob! Bob! Where are you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Dick who called out, about quarter of
an hour after Bob had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party was ready to descend into the gigantic
cave once more, and wondered why Bob did
not return.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where can he have gone?" asked Robert
Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I reckon as how somethin' has happened to
him," burst out old Jacob, putting away the
short briar-root pipe he had been smoking.
"Didn't he saunter off in thet direction?" and
he pointed with his long finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He did," answered Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is Dash? He will find him," cried
Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>They looked around for the dog, but he was
nowhere in sight, having gone off on a trail of
his own after some small ground-animal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon the entire party was hunting in earnest
for Bob, but without success.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached the pool of water, old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Jacob inspected the wet ground with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Here are lots o' footprints," he exclaimed.
"Poor Bob's got into trouble, jest as I supposed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Some of the prints are of naked feet," put in
Leander. "Those negroes with Farvel were
barefooted."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's true," said Robert Menden. "Can it
be possible that Bob has been carried off by
Farvel and his tools."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It looks that way," said Leander. "The
question is, what have they done with our
chum?"</p>

<p class='c000'>All stared blankly at each other. Then Don
got down on his knees and began another examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I was an Indian I might follow this trail,"
he said; "but as it is, I fancy I am not equal to
it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If only Dash was here," sighed Leander.
"What can have become of that dog? Dash!
Dash!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The call was followed by several others. At
last came a short, suppressed bark from a
neighboring thicket. Instantly Don and Leander
made a run in that direction, and arrived
just in time to see a big black fellow running
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stop, or I'll fire at you!" cried Don, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>pulled his pistol; but in a second more the
fellow was out of range behind several trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>The native had been sent forward to kill the
canine, Farvel feeling certain that otherwise
Dash would be used to locate his captive master.</p>

<p class='c000'>The native had been in the act of firing at
Dash, when Leander and Don appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was, Dash was limping painfully from
a slight wound in the fore-shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Good dog!" cried Don. "So he meant to kill
you? Too bad!" And he hugged faithful old
Dash around the neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The others soon came up, and it was decided
to follow the trail of the native without delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was an easy but slow undertaking for
Dash, and this time they kept up with the canine
with ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trail led directly to where Farvel was
keeping Bob a prisoner, and they came in sight
just as the rascal had punched the helpless lad
in the nose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, the villain!" cried Dick, and rushing up
behind Farvel he hit the man such a heavy blow
in the neck that Farvel dropped like a log.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing this, the native disappeared, and it
may as well be stated here that he did not return,
nor did the other black come back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Farvel was nearly stunned, and by the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>he recovered, old Jacob had released Bob by cutting
the vines with his sharp jack-knife.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who—what—" stammered Farvel, when he
could speak. Then he saw the crowd gathered
around him and his face fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, how glad I am that you came up," cried
Bob. "I believe he was going to kill me!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wasn't going to do anything of the sort,"
growled Farvel. "You just let me alone."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I fancy I will let you alone," panted Bob,
"after I am square with you. Take that!"
And as the man got up, Bob slapped him with
such force in the mouth that Farvel's teeth
rattled. "You are a brute, and ought to be in
jail."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tell us your story, Bob," said Robert Menden,
and the tale was speedily forthcoming.
Farvel tried several times to interrupt, but was
not allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll make him our prisoner now," said old
Jacob, grimly. "It ain't safe to leave him
roamin' around loose."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Me a prisoner!" gasped Joseph Farvel. "I
rather guess not!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, tie him up," said Bob. "We can set
him free later on, when we hand him over to the
authorities."</p>

<p class='c000'>Farvel fumed and used language not fit to
transcribe to these pages. But this availed him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>nothing, and soon his hands were bound as
tightly as Bob's had been.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now march!" ordered old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where to?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"March, an' ye'll find out soon enough. Forward,
or I'll boot ye!" and the old tar looked so
fierce that Farvel moved off without further
parley.</p>

<p class='c000'>The course of the party was directly for the
cave entrance. Arriving here, a consultation
was held, and it was decided to take Farvel to
a grove some distance to the left. Here the
rascal was fastened to a cedar tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll come back for you by night," said
Robert Menden. "In the meantime here are
some crackers and a drink of water for you,"
and he held them up so that Farvel could get at
them. At first the fellow wanted to refuse, but
soon thought better of it, having a fear of suffering
from thirst and hunger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Farvel was boiling with inward rage.
Yet he did not dare say too much, fearing that
the party would turn on him. Soon he was left
to himself. Yet they were not yet done with
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A good bit of time lost," remarked Robert
Menden, as he consulted his watch. "But I am
glad we now have Farvel where he can do us no
further harm."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>The entrance to the cave passed, they speedily
found their way to the chamber of bones, and
then to where the tablet was located.</p>

<p class='c000'>All was exactly as they had left it and Robert
Menden breathed a long sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now, we ought to have that treasure in our
possession before we leave to-night," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ye can't git it none too quick for any o'
us!" grinned old Jacob. "Ain't thet so, boys?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You're right!" cried Dick. "Hurry up with
the ropes."</p>

<p class='c000'>The coils were speedily forthcoming, and the
two heaviest were well knotted together. Then
Robert Menden prepared to descend once more—this
time with the canvas bag on his back.
In one hand he carried a fresh torch, which
made that portion of the crack in the rocks
almost as bright as day.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gently now," he cautioned, as he swung
downward. "I don't want to break my neck
for all the gold on the island."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We'll be careful," answered Bob; and then
all took hold of the rope, and Menden was lowered
slowly but steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had passed something like twenty feet
further down than on his previous trip, when
he called to them to halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've found a resting-place," he said, when
Dick threw himself flat to look down into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>gloom. "It's a sort of ledge. There is a wider
opening further down."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is the box there?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't see it—yet. Hold onto the rope, for
I may slip from here at any instant."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick promised to do so, and all kept the line
taut as before. They heard Menden moving
around and heard him toss several small rocks
aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came a sudden yell, followed by the fall
of some dirt or rocks, they could not tell which.
The rope came up so quickly that all fell back
in dismay.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Something is wrong!" gasped Don. "Menden,
are you all right?"</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no answer to his cry, and he and
Dick bent over the edge to investigate. But
the torch was hidden, or had gone out, and they
could see nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Haul up the rope," said old Jacob, quietly;
and it was quickly done. The noose which had
been around Menden's body was gone, and the
end of the line showed that it had been cut by
the edge of a jagged stone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> FINDING THE SPANISH TREASURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Has he been killed?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What shall we do next?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can't see or hear anything of him."</p>

<p class='c000'>One and another stared at his companions.
Robert Menden was gone, and there was no telling
what had become of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll go down and find out," said Dick, determinedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But the danger, lad—" began old Jacob.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll be very careful, Jacob. I have no wish
to lose my life. But we must do something,
you know."</p>

<p class='c000'>The old sailor shook his head doubtfully.
"If you lose your life, lad, I'll never be able to
face your folks—not me!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, he allowed Dick to tie the end
of the jagged rope around him, and then the
boy was lowered over the brink of the fissure,
also with a lighted torch in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down and down he went, and still down,
until he felt as if he was entering the very
bowels of the earth. His heart beat violently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>and several times he could hardly keep from
calling to those left behind to pull him up. But
he was grit, and kept on descending until the
ledge upon which Menden had stood was gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>All was uncertain about him. The jagged
rocks loomed up all around him, and to one side
was the vast opening the Englishman had mentioned.
Dick waved his torch over it and concluded
it was a bottomless pit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several tons of rocks had fallen, but most of
the mass had gone over the edge of the ledge.
There was a heap of small stones close at hand,
and looking down among these the youth saw
Robert Menden's body, partly covered up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can he be dead?" he asked himself. "Oh, I
pray God he is alive!" And then he heard the
Englishman utter a short groan.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He's alive!" he shouted. "But he's badly
wounded."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Better send him up, then," returned Leander.
"Do you want another rope?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was speedily forthcoming, but, alas! it
proved too short by a dozen feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let down some more," called Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can't. That's all we have."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It won't do."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can't you tie him on the rope you have?"
asked Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Yes, Dick could do that. But such a proceeding
would leave him on the ledge without
a safeguard. He shivered at the thought.
Then he grated his teeth. "I must do it," he
muttered. "It's the only way." He slipped
down on his knees, and extricated the body from
the stones and dirt that held it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, my head!" groaned Robert Menden, and
replased into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c000'>With extreme caution Dick untied the noose
about him, and adjusted it under Menden's
arms. Then he braced himself on the ledge,
and called to those above to haul away, and they
did so. As the body swung upward, the canvas
bag slipped on Dick's head, and he let it fall to
his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no mean task to get the unconscious
man to the top of the fissure and to a place of
safety. But this accomplished, old Jacob set
to work to bind up his wounds and restore him
to himself. In the meantime the boys lowered
the rope once more for Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>His first feeling of horror over, Dick began
to gaze around him curiously. He hardly dared
to move, for fear of pitching headlong into the
pit; but he brought the torch low, and by its
flames made out what looked to be a portion of
some boards just beyond where he was standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dick, the rope is coming!" called Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>"All right—I have it,"—and with a sigh of
relief the boy adjusted the end of the coil once
more under his arms. He now felt free to move,
and advanced upon the boards with caution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nearest came up with ease, and he saw it
was of cedar and varnished upon one side. Then
he looked further, and saw—shining gold!</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a regular heap of it—Spanish
doubloons and other coins of the realm—enough
to fill his canvas bag three times over. At the
sight he could scarcely contain himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hurrah!" he yelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you found it?" came from above.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; a regular heap of gold, boys, all
tumbled out of the chest, which has gone to
pieces. We're in luck, and no further doubt
of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a hurrah from those above, and
Danny and Don executed a jig of delight. In
the midst of the uproar, Robert Menden sat up
and stared about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Whe—where am I?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are safe," replied old Jacob. "An' the
treasure is found!" he added with a happy
smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Found! Good! But the rock fell——"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you went down under it, sir. But you'll
be all right. Dick went down for you, and he's
just passed up word that the gold is there."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>"He must be careful. I—I—oh, my head!"
and Robert Menden fell back again, too weak
to go on. Yet he, like all the others, was supremely
happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without waiting, Dick began to fill the canvas
bag, doing so with care, that none of the
golden coins might become lost. Then he tied
the bag to the rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Haul away on the first load!" he cried, and
they hauled away with vigor. At the sight of
so much shining gold Danny nearly had a
spasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, if dat don't beat de nation!" he gasped.
"Dare must be most a fortune dare!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's a fine pile!" burst out Leander. "Tell
you what, fellows, it was worth coming for,
eh?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Any more down there?" yelled Bob, to
Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, two bagfuls," came the muffled reply.
"Send down the bag again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Two bags!" ejaculated old Jacob. "Boys,
we'll be rich—that is, you'll be."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You shan't be forgotten," answered Don,
hastily. "Nor Danny neither."</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the canvas bag was lowered and Dick
began the task of filling it a second time.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had to work with extreme care, for the
ledge slanted considerably, and at one point it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>ran almost directly downward and was shaky
besides, and he could scarcely keep his footing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up came the second bagful, and then the third
followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Keep it up there, now," called out Dick.
"I'll bring the rest in my pockets."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't miss any," shouted Don. "These
doubloons are worth sixteen or eighteen dollars
each."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I don't intend to miss any," answered Dick;
"but it's no mean work to move around down
here—I can tell you that."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Be careful," cried old Jacob. "If you have
the most on it, better come up."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; leave the odds and ends of coin go,"
shouted Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry from Dick interrupted him. "Here's
something else, boys—a little bag full of stones."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Diamonds?" queried Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can't say, for the bag is sealed up, and it's
marked M. M. M. I'll be up soon now."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick continued to hunt around, in the meantime
adjusting the rope under his arms, that a
slip might not prove too dangerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three more Spanish gold pieces were sighted,
also a curious golden cross set with rubies.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last it looked as if he had secured everything
of value, and he called to those above to
haul him up.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>The others were busy counting up the gold
pieces, but responded without delay, and in a
minute he was swinging clear of the ledge and
moving upward slowly but steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'>His torch had almost gone out, and threw out
far more smoke than flame.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly, when he was midway between the
top of the opening and the edge, something
caught his eye which filled him with horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some manner the torch had set fire to the
rope at a point two feet over his head. The
strands were burning freely, and it looked as if
in a few seconds more the rope would be burnt
through.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> A DANGEROUS TUMBLE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Pull up quick, boys! The rope is on fire!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was Dick's agonizing cry as he made his
dire discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The rope is on fire?" repeated Bob. "How
did that happen?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I must have set it on fire with my torch.
Quick! or it will part and I'll have a bad fall."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hoist away, all hands!" sang out old Jacob,
and exerted all of his strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old tar and the others meant well, but
it would have been much better had Dick been
lowered to his original resting-place. Yet up
he came, until he was almost within reach of the
top of the fissure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came the dreaded parting of the burning
rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down shot the boy, down and down.</p>

<p class='c000'>His feet struck the ledge; but he could not
save himself, and with a scream that rang in
his companions' ears for days afterward, he
went over the ledge, down and down, until nothing
more could be heard of him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>As the burning rope parted, all of those holding
the upper end were thrown on their backs,
but leaped up quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He's gone!" gasped Leander, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dick! Dick! where are you?" cried Don,
peering into the darkness below; for even the
torch had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>No answer came back, although they listened
with strained ears. All was as silent as a
tomb.</p>

<p class='c000'>And was that to prove poor Dick's grave?
Silently they asked themselves the question, as
one looked at another, all with blanched faces.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'd rather lose the fortune," said Don, voicing
the sentiment of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Give me that other rope, lads," exclaimed old
Jacob. "I'll go down for him."</p>

<p class='c000'>He stepped upon the burning end of rope and
put it out. Then the reserve coil was fastened
on, and he tied the end under his arms and lit
another torch.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Don't set the rope afire again," cautioned
Bob. He could scarcely trust himself to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No danger," answered the Yankee sailor.
"Let me down carefully now," he added, and disappeared
over the edge of the opening.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down he went until the ledge was reached.
Here he paused to survey the situation. Nothing
but the loose rocks and the remains of the
shattered cedar chest met his gaze.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>"Dick! Dick!" he called.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no answer, and the look on his face
grew more serious than ever. The boy had gone
further. But to where?</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let me down some more," he called up.
"But be careful. It's mighty skeery down
here."</p>

<p class='c000'>They promised to be careful, and the rope was
let down inch by inch, until old Jacob had
reached a point fifteen feet below the ledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's all the rope we have here," cried Bob.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankee tar remained dangling in midair.
On all sides of him were the walls of rock, dripping
with moisture. He held the torch down,
and saw, far below, the glitter of some dark,
underground stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick had fallen into that. But where was
he? The question was one impossible to answer.
With care old Jacob took some light
string from his pocket and threw it into the
water. Like a flash a strong current seized it
and carried it under a neighboring wall!</p>

<p class='c000'>"He's gone, poor boy!" he muttered; and
something like a tear stole down his bronzed
cheek, for he thought a good deal of the young
master of the Dashaway. From the top of the
opening he heard Dash set up a dismal howl, as
if to confirm his opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a sorry crowd that gathered to hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>what the old tar might have to say when he came
up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you think he was carried away by that
stream?" observed Don, sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No doubt on it, lad. He wasn't in sight, and
the water fills the entire bottom of the opening."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then he is gone!" gasped Leander, bursting
into tears, and little Danny joined in.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dat's de wust yet!" sobbed the Irish lad.
"I don't want none o' dat gold—now!" And
the others felt very much the same way.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've a good mind to go down and have a
look," said Bob, and insisted upon it despite old
Jacob's protestations. But he learned nothing
new. Then Don went down, followed by Leander.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was the same, and all were forced
to believe that poor Dick had been carried off
by the underground stream to a watery grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time Robert Menden was able to sit
up, and though still weak, he insisted upon
being told about what had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is certainly bad," he said. "I suppose
I can be thankful that I did not meet a similar
fate."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That's true," answered old Jacob. "But I
am not going to give up yet."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you intend to do?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>"Get a longer rope from somewhere and examine
thet hole thoroughly. If I only git his
body it will be better nor nuthin'."</p>

<p class='c000'>The matter was talked over for a few minutes,
and then old Jacob hurried off alone, to where
they had left Joseph Farvel a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>A surprise awaited the old sailor. In some
unaccountable manner, Farvel had become free,
and had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under ordinary circumstances old Jacob
would have begun an investigation but now
other matters filled his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Farvel had left the rope which had bound
him, and this the old tar appropriated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inside of half an hour he was back to where
he had left the boys and Robert Menden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once more the rope was lengthened, and
tested from end to end.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now be very careful how you hold it," said
old Jacob. "It's no fool of a job to handle
sech a long coil. And remember, if I whistle
twice, let down; and if I whistle once, pull up.
Three whistles, leave the rope as it is."</p>

<p class='c000'>Once more he went down; first to the ledge
and then to the very surface of the underground
stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the water five to six feet deep, and
running so strongly, that by going in up to his
neck he was carried along so fiercely that the
rope almost broke under the tension.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>"He has been swept away and thet's the end
on it," he muttered; and whistled to the others
to hoist him up.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an almost silent crowd that bundled
the treasure up in the canvas bag and a blanket
which had been brought along for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish we hadn't come to Porto Rico," whispered
Bob to Leander. "What will Dick's folks
say of this when we tell them?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'd like to know who is going to break the
news," added Leander. "I'm sure I can't do
it;" and he gave something like a shiver.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Menden was feeling better, and presently
he said he felt strong enough to walk to
their camp. He leaned on old Jacob's arm,
while the boys carried the treasure between
them. The rope was left dangling in the water.
"So that poor Dick can use it, if he comes
around," as Bob said, clutching at a hope that
was vain-less.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night found them established in a new camp,
still sad, and next to silent. They had the
treasure safe, but at what a fearful cost.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It's enough to make one fling it away,"
sighed Bob. And when Robert Menden began
to count up the gold, he turned away, unable to
endure the sight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> WHAT BECAME OF DICK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>"Where on earth, or under the earth, am I
now?"</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Dick who uttered the remark, as he
crawled out of the stream, and sat down on a
slippery and slimy rock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tumble over the ledge had been broken
by a fall into the underground stream, and he
had been hurled along by the current for a distance
of fully two hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had felt that he was drowning and could
hold his breath no longer, when he had shot up
into pitch dark space, and climbed onto the rock
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was almost exhausted, and for several
minutes could do little but pant and hold on.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not the slightest idea where he was,
saving that he had reached some lower shaft of
the gigantic cave.</p>

<p class='c000'>His companions must be above him, but how
far, there was no telling.</p>

<p class='c000'>His heart sank within his breast and he felt
like giving himself up for lost.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>"I can't swim back," he thought, as he remembered
how that mad current had hurled
him onward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ten minutes passed. He felt around for his
torch, but it was nowhere within reach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he got a firmer hold on the rock with one
hand, while with the other he pulled a match-safe
from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luckily the safe was a water-proof one, and
the contents were, therefore, dry. Soon he had
a lucifer lit, and by its tiny light he sprang to
the shore of the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were some odds and ends of driftwood
there—grass and bits of tree twigs—and of these
he made a little fire. Then he bethought himself
and set up a yell.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as we know, his cries were not heard, and
no answering call came back. The only sound
that broke the stillness was that of the water as
it took a plunge downward at one end of the
opening he had entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I guess I'm in a trap," he muttered. "But
I must get out somehow. Oh, God, help me to
get out!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The prayer was repeated over and over again,
and at last the boy grew calmer. Then he took
the flaring driftwood in his hands and set out
on a tour of inspection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chamber he had entered was not over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>twenty feet wide by three times as long. To
one side the roof sloped downward, and here
there appeared to be another opening, running
to some higher level.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Anyway to get out," thought Dick, and
scrambled up the slope. It was rough, and
more than once he went down; but he picked
himself up quickly and went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The upper chamber gained, the youth saw before
him a long and winding gallery, moving
gradually to a still higher level. Should he
follow this?</p>

<p class='c000'>Again he prayed for Divine aid, and then
went on, over loose rocks and across ugly cracks.
The driftwood had nearly burnt itself out, and
his fingers were blistered in several places from
holding it. Soon he would be in darkness
again, and what should he do, then? He
looked around for something more that might
be lighted, but nothing showed itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>On and on, and still on, following one turn
after another. Now the driftwood had flickered
down to the last dead twig. He tried to
save the tiny flame—but with a flicker it went
out—and all became as black as night around
him—yes, even blacker than night.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sank down on a rock, almost stunned.
All of the stories of people lost in caves and coal
mines that he had ever heard about, crossed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>mind—how they had wandered about for days
without food and drink and light, to be found
at last either dead or jibbering idiots. He felt
that it would not take much to turn him crazy.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long he remained on the rock he could
never tell. At last, like one in a dream, he got
up and ran—ran as hard as he could, as though
a legion of demons were after him—along one
rocky wall and another. His outstretched
hands and good fortune saved him from many a
nasty bump, and thus fully a mile was covered,
when he fell down so exhausted he could not go
another step.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'm buried alive!" he cried aloud; and a
thousand echoes answered him: "Buried alive—alive—alive!"
Then a strange vision came
to him of untold horrors—snakes, demons, falling
rocks and great torrents of water—and he
fell flat in terror, and fainted.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Dick came to his senses he leaped up,
then sank back exhausted. Clearly he was out
of his mind—for he thought that he was in a
beautiful palace, and that a fairy of gold was
dancing before him. Then the fairy seemed to
motion him to come on, and he moved along
slowly and painfully for fully a quarter of a
mile. Presently the vision left him, and he
sank down once again, only to get up when he
was able, and run, he knew not where.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Ha! what was that? a light, or only another
hallucination? No, no, it was a light—a spot
of sunshine, streaming in from some opening
overhead. He gave a shout of joy. Oh, to be
free once more! Never, never, would he enter
that cave again.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was some time before he could locate the
opening. Then to get to it was difficult. But
the light gave him a superhuman strength, and
up he went, over one rock after another, climbing
a height that would have made him dizzy
had he been able to see his way.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the opening was gained. It lay between
two immense rocks, and he had all he
could do to squeeze through. When he came
into the outer air, the first thing that he noticed
was that the sun was rising, not setting. He
had been underground all night!</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at himself. He was thoroughly
soaked, and covered with mud and a sort of soot.
His face and hands were as dirty as his clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But I don't care," he murmured, half aloud.
"Thank God I am safe! Oh, what an adventure
that was!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Not far away was a mountain spring, and
here Dick got a drink, and then washed himself.
He had no idea in what direction the
camp lay.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>"I wonder what the others thought when I
disappeared," he mused. "I'll wager they felt
pretty bad, Bob especially. Won't they be surprised
to see me safe and sound!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He was close to the very top of the mountain,
and resolved to make a circle around the summit
and see if he could not locate the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Travelling here was easy, for the bushes grew
but scatteringly, and there were hardly any
trees. Presently he reached a slight eminence,
and from this point made out the smoke of a
camp-fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That must be our camp," he said to himself,
and struck off in the direction. Soon he was
in the midst of the jungle, but managed to keep
a straight course. Now his scare was over, he
felt very hungry, but could not bring himself
to stop for anything to eat.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Danny shall supply me," was his thought.
"I know he'll be only too glad to give me the best
on hand."</p>

<p class='c000'>The jungle passed, he came to a small clearing
overlooking a deep valley. The camp-fire was
just ahead. Not a soul was in sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have they gone on a hunt for me?" he mused,
when of a sudden a man leaped upon him and
bore him to the ground with ease. The man was
Joseph Farvel.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Turn about is fair play, I reckon," growled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the rascal. "Didn't expect to run across me,
did you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let go of me," cried Dick.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I'll let go," was the sarcastic rejoinder.
"You had lots of mercy on me, didn't you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You started the quarrel, Joseph Farvel."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did I? I reckon not. You did that—when
you came here after the treasure that belongs to
me. Tell me—has your party found anything
yet?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I won't tell you a word."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I'll make you!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You can't do it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can't I? We'll see. Come."</p>

<p class='c000'>With brutal force the man dragged the weak
and worn-out lad to his camp. With some
handy vines he bound Dick's hands behind him,
and then fastened the youth to a slanting rock.
The rock was thin and set up against a second
rock, leaving an opening like the letter A beneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the opening Farvel kicked the burning
embers of the fire, and then heaped on more fuel.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now we'll see how you feel when your legs
begin to get warm," he cried. "I reckon those
vines will not catch for quite awhile, they are
that green."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Would you burn me?" cried Dick, in horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And why not?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>"You are as bad as the savage Indians used
to be!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I mean to have my rights," growled Farvel.
"Now if you have anything to tell me, out with
it."</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> GOOD-BYE TO PORTO RICO—CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Dick felt his heart sink within him. Farvel
was in an exceedingly ugly mood, and looked as
if he fully intended to let the youth suffer as he
had intimated.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You rascal! What is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The words were spoken in English, and caused
Joseph Farvel to jump as though he had been
shot. Turning, he saw himself confronted by
several gentlemen, one of whom carried a pistol.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mr. Grey!" gasped Dick—as he recognized
the gentleman Bob had brought to the Dashaway,
while taking on stores at St. Augustine—"Help
me, please!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, is it possible!" ejaculated the merchant.
"You are—er—the young man from
that yacht, are you not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And who is this—this villain?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"An Englishman, who has tried to do our
party a great deal of injury. He claims that a
treasure that we have been hunting for belongs
to him."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>"That is no reason why he should treat you
in this fashion. Stand where you are, sir, while
I release the youth."</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the party sprang to Dick's side and
one cut the vines. Then Garrison Grey turned
to collar Joseph Farvel.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the rascal realized the position he was in,
and not wishing to serve a term in prison, he
dashed away, straight for the jungle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick went after him and called upon Mr.
Grey to do the same, and soon the entire party
of newcomers were in the chase.</p>

<p class='c000'>More alarmed than ever, Joseph Farvel
turned from the jungle toward a high bank overlooking
the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was not careful of his footsteps, and of a
sudden he plunged into a rocky gully all of fifty
feet deep.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned over twice in his fall and then
landed on his chest and shoulder. When the
party got to where he was lying, they found him
unconscious.</p>

<p class='c000'>The newcomers were all Americans, out
sight-seeing, and one of them was a well-known
physician of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you think of this case, Doctor
Carey?" asked Mr. Grey, while Dick looked on
with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He has his shoulder broken and also several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>ribs," replied the physician, after a thorough
examination. "Luckily for him, I doubt if
there are any internal injuries."</p>

<p class='c000'>While the physician set to work to make
Joseph Farvel as easy as circumstances permitted,
the others turned to Dick and made him
relate his tale, the boy only omitting the interesting
detail that the treasure had been found.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I've heard of these treasures, in Ponce," said
the coffee trader. "They will belong to anybody
who finds them. The smuggler who placed
them there left no heirs."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dick thought Joseph Farvel had suffered
enough for his misdeeds, and decided to let the
man go his own way—which was not saving
much, as he had to be conveyed by litter to a
wretched little hospital at Caguas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the man laid on a sick bed for nearly
four months, when he made his way to Ponce, on
money furnished by Robert Menden. Menden
likewise furnished Farvel with money to take
him back to England, where he remained a
sadder and, probably, a wiser man. The members
of the Gun and Sled Club never heard of
him again. "And we never wanted to," said
Bob, in telling of the circumstance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Garrison Grey's party had met old Jacob and
the others on the road, and they directed Dick
to his friends' camp. The owner of the Dashaway
was hailed as one from the tomb.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>"The Lord be praised!" cried old Jacob, as he
embraced the lad; and then the others joined in,
until happy Dick was almost hugged to death.
Danny danced an Irish jig for joy, and prepared
such a spread as none of the party had eaten
since leaving the yacht.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was decided by all hands, now that the
treasure was found, to go back to the Dashaway
without delay; and inside of twenty-four hours
they were on the way to Caguas. Here Robert
Menden paid a short visit to Joseph Farvel;
but what passed between the pair never came
to light, excepting that Menden gave the man
the money mentioned. "Poor beggar; I couldn't
do less," was all Menden would say.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Caguas the party hired a native carriage,
and with the treasure divided between them,
set off on the ride to San Juan. All were
armed, and a strict watch was kept for brigands;
but Bumbum had learned a lesson and did not
appear, nor did any others of his calling put in
an appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>At San Juan the Dashaway was found just
as they had left her, and it was with a long sigh
of relief that Dick and the others boarded the
craft, followed by the ever-faithful Dash. At
once the man who had had charge of the craft
was paid off, and stores sufficient to last them
for a trip to the United States were taken on
board.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>It was decided to run directly for Savannah,
and they dropped out of the harbor of San Juan
one bright morning when nature seemed to be
at its loveliest. The sun was shining brightly,
the sea was almost as smooth as glass, and
scarcely a cloud dotted the deep blue sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Good-bye to Porto Rico!" cried Bob, swinging
his cap in the air. And all of the others
echoed the words. Then they sped on their
course, and before night, town and coastline had
faded far away in the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must not be imagined that the return to the
States was made without incident. As in coming,
they encountered a severe storm, and once
came very close to drifting on the rocks in a
calm, when the anchor was lost and not recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>But taken all in all, the voyage was a happy
one. On the first days out they tried to count
up the value of the treasure. But this was impossible,
as they had no idea what the precious
stones would bring in.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I believe the gold is worth all of twenty thousand
dollars," said Robert Menden. "Perhaps
the stones are worth as much more."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That will be forty thousand dollars," replied
Leander. "Quite a haul, eh?" and he winked
his eye joyfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were in the best of spirits, and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Danny was not working, he was dancing, or
singing or whistling at the top of his lung
power. "We'll be millionaires, dat's wot!" he
was wont to say, to anybody who would listen
to him. He intended to give nearly all of his
share to his mother—a poor widow, who took in
washing for a living. "It will most strike her
dead; I know it will!" he whispered one day to
Don.</p>

<p class='c000'>But all voyages must come to an end, and
one morning old Jacob electrified everybody by
announcing that land was in sight. Before
night they entered the harbor of Savannah.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Robert Menden, old Jacob and Bob,
who took the gold to one of the banks and got a
receipt for it. Carefully weighed, the treasure
proved to be worth twenty-two thousand and
three hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the stones were taken to a reliable
jewelry firm, sorted and tested. Their value
brought the total amount of the treasure to a
little over fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this, Robert Menden insisted upon keeping
only one-half. The other twenty-five thousand
was placed to Dick's credit. Of this amount
the members of the Gun and Sled Club divided
five thousand equally between old Jacob and
Danny, and kept the twenty thousand for themselves—Dick,
Don, Bob and Leander to share
and share alike.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>The good news was sent ahead by mail, and
created a veritable sensation in Waterford.
Poor Mrs. Guirk could not believe her good fortune,
and shed tears of joy when Squire Hobart
read to her the letter Danny had managed to
pen, with Bob's aid.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sure an' it's a blessing from Heaven, Squire,"
said she. "Danny's a good b'y, but I niver expected
this of him, never!" And she wiped her
tears away with her apron.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Dashaway arrived at home the boys
found the water-front of the town decorated in
their honor. A grand feast was had at the home
of Dick Wilbur, and here their various adventures
had to be told again and again, for the
benefit of the club members' parents, and their
numerous friends. It was a jolly time and one
never to be forgotten; and here we will leave
them, satisfied that, no matter what adventures
they may have in the future, they will never have
any more thrilling than those encountered while
treasure-hunting in Porto Rico.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hero of Ticonderoga and leader
of the Green Mountain Boys is best
known for his characteristic demand
upon the British garrison at Fort Ticonderoga,
on Lake Champlain, to surrender
"in the name of the Continental Congress
and the Great Jehovah." This book not
only gives a full account of the exploits
of Colonel Allen, but contains also a
brief history of Vermont, formerly called
the New Hampshire Grants, in her contention
with New York authorities, who
opposed Vermont's admission into the
Union, but which was finally accomplished
by Ethan Allen. "It is the best

<p class='c000'>American history gleams with the
brilliant achievements of her adopted
sons. No historian ever wearies in telling
of the glorious deeds and self-sacrifices
of Lafayette, de Kalb, Pulaski,
Kosciuszko, de Grasse, Rochambeau,
Steuben, St. Clair, d'Estaing and John
Paul Jones, who gave up home and
country to aid the struggling colonists
in their fight for freedom. This is one of
the most patriotic books, both from a
literary and artistic standpoint, ever
issued. It is printed on a superior quality of paper with a dozen
or more half-tone portraits of the principal actors, who participated
in our struggle for independence, together with a chart and
views of Jones' most daring exploits on the coasts of England and
on the Black Sea, with his portrait in the full uniform of Admiral
of the United States Navy, of which he was the founder. Cover
stamped in red, white and gold on a navy blue silk cloth, showing
in beautiful colors the colonial flags and American shield with its
thirteen stars and stripes, with Jones' sword in gold as ornamental
back stamp. Size, 5⅝ × 7⅞; nearly 300 pages; 12mo; cloth.</p>

<p class='c005'>For all general mechanical work, this is the
most valuable book for the farmer, blacksmith,
carpenter, carriage and wagon building, painting
and varnishing trades published. The department
on Blacksmithing is based on the
various text books by Prof. A. Lungwitz, Director
of the Shoeing School of the Royal Veterinary
College at Dresden, while the chapters on Carriage
and Wagon Building, Painting, Varnishing,
are by Charles F. Adams, one of the
most successful builders in Wisconsin. The
language employed is so simple that any young
man of average ability can, in a short time, become
proficient in all of these useful and profitable
occupations. Each chapter is fully illustrated,
there being more than 50 drawings
throughout the book.</p>

<p class='c005'>The subject of house building is of interest to
all, even though financially they are at present unable

for all to anticipate the realization of a home and
become familiar with the requisites of a good house,
barn, warehouse or other necessary building. This
valuable work contains not only Plans and Specifications
for Dwellings, but Clubs, Churches, Public
Buildings, Barns, and all necessary outbuildings for
Farms, Country Seats, Suburban Homes, etc.; accurate

<p class='c000'>Every young man and woman of reasonable intelligence
is, or ought to be, possessed of a laudable
ambition to be self-sustaining. To win a competency,
to secure the necessities, to have even the luxuries
of life, is perfectly praiseworthy, provided they
are obtained in a legitimate manner. Every rational
man seeks the occupation, trade or profession which
insures the profitable employment of his best talents,
and the science which discloses to the youth
at the beginning of his education what those talents
are and how they may be developed to perfection in
early manhood, confers upon him the greatest favor
within the gift of knowledge, from a financial standpoint. That
a knowledge of Phrenology does this, and more, this book proves
beyond all question.</p>

Produced by Richard Tonsing, David Edwards and the Online
Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This
book was produced from scanned images of public domain
material from the Google Books project.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
